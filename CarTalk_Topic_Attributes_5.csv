1,New Car Salesperson Commissions,Buying/Selling,[],wolyrobb,"['wentwest', 'shadowfax', 'VOLVO-V70', 'Triedaq', 'ok4450', 'TCerebus', 'Mustangman']","I’ve been working with a particular salesperson for the purchase of my new car.  He has been really helpful and spent time with me to select the correct vehicle.  I’m now ready to buy.  I’ve tried coming to the dealership on a couple different days, but something came up at home and I couldn’t make it out there.  Hard to find the time.  This afternoon I have an open time period (rare) and could go to make the purchase.  But my salesperson doesn’t work today, so if I go a different salesperson would be making the sale.  I’m thinking that if I went today, my original salesperson (who put in all the time) would lose out on any commission … and that seems disloyal since he did all the real work.  Is that correct?  Would only today’s salesperson get the commission?  Thanks.","['No one here can tell you what any dealers commission policies are . Call the dealers Sales Manager and tell him that you want to make sure that the person does get the commission .', 'Yes, the person you worked with would get screwed out of the commission. If you talk to the sales manager they might split the commission but that isn’t fair either, is it? Setup an appointment time for your saleman and you to finalize the deal.', 'Second thought -  You should have the salesman’s card with his phone number . Call it and he might make it in to complete sale or make a time when the vehicle can be delivered to you .  My neighbor did every thing by phone and email and had a new vehicle delivered from a dealer 120 miles away to his home.', 'Summary - Even though I had the time available yesterday morning, I decided to change my schedule around so that I could come to the dealership this morning instead.  My original salesperson works today … so he could get my sale … problem solved.  Well I phoned him at 9am today, and he is too busy to see me until later this afternoon (which won’t work for me).\nSo, I changed everything so that he could make the sale … and he is too busy to see me.  Guess that serves me right for trying to be conscientious.  I should have gone yesterday and just let “whoever” make the sale!', 'I think you did the right thing.  I had a somewhat similar problem back in 2006.  I was looking at a 2006 Chevrolet Uplander that was a “program” car (whatever that is).  I went to the agency in my work clothes and my 28 year old Oldsmobile Cutlass.  All but one salesperson ignored me.  I took it for a test drive and decided to check out a couple other dealers.  I decided I wanted the Uplander.  I went back the next morning to buy the Uplander.  I was dressed up as I had been to my office earlier.  I was also driving my 2000 Ford Windstar.  Three salespersons immediately came to help.  When I asked for the salesperson I had worked with the previous day, I was told it was his day off.  I then said I would come back the next day.  Suddenly, the salesperson I had worked with became available.', 'I agree with Triedaq. You did the right thing. Now, if the salesperson can’t get with you at this point, you should feel free to buy the car from someone else with a clear conscience.', 'The salesperson is “too busy”.  I inconvenienced myself, but he wasn’t willing to inconvenience himself.  Didn’t even suggest I come in and see another salesperson … sale isn’t important to him.  I don’t want the drama of seeing him if I go in and deal with a different salesperson.  So, I’m going to buy the car from a different dealership entirely.', 'The commission could have been split between the two salespersons, The local Ford dealership has no commission salespeople and gives reasonable deals with only tax and title added beyond the price on the windshield.', 'Just some food for thought, but you state that you had been in several times already. Now there were intentions of going in again.\nMaybe it’s possible the original salesman thought you were not a serious car buyer due to the back and forth?\nThose guys are under a mountain of pressure to make every sale and it could be that behind the scenes one or even both could have been chewed on royally.', 'The sales person dealt with you in a way you appreciated, showed consideration and knowledge.  Now you want to buy, but when you decided to go and do the deal they were busy with someone else.  No surprise there, the person is a good sales pro and attends to the work at hand.  Just as you would make an appointment with a dentist or an accountant or a building contractor, and then expect them to deal with you without interruptions to juggle other customers, you should do the same thing with this salesperson. Make an appointment.']",12,559
2,Best used car to buy for long road trips?,Buying/Selling,['used-cars'],Whitey,"['texases', 'VOLVO-V70', 'Marnet', 'lion9car', 'francomamanda', 'Triedaq', 'Bing', 'Docnick', 'irlandes', 'Manolito', 'VDCdriver', 'cdaquila', 'Mustangman', 'blue03v']","Hello! I am new to the site and am having a dilemma… what is a good used car to buy for distance driving?
Until now, I have been driving a 2004 Volvo S80 sedan. I bought it in 2013 with 121k miles and have since added 24k miles to it. It now needs repairs costing more than the car is worth. I loved my Volvo but I am now in the market for something along the lines of a Toyota, Honda, or Subaru, 2011 or newer. I drive from Utah to California a few times a year, totaling about 1,414 miles round trip each time.
I am just looking for something reliable and was wondering if anyone could give me an opinion, as I don’t know a whole lot about cars! ","['The answer to your question depends far more on you than anything we can tell you. What is your highest priority? Comfort? Fuel economy? Reliability? How much do you want to spend? Why have you targeted 2011?\nA Toyota, Honda or Subaru can be reliable enough  to get you there and back. The smaller models, like Yaris or Fit. Subaru didn’t have a comparable model. These cars may not fit your desires if you want a bigger car. That would take a Corolla or Camry, Civic or Accord or Impreza.\nKey to buying an over- 100,000 mile car is condition. Any car you are considering should be checked over by a mechanic NOT affiliated with the dealer you might buy from. At that kind of mileage, condition is more important than brand. Consider that cheaper models will get you a newer car within your budget and that can be a good thing given you only drive 6000 miles a year.', '\n\n\n Mustangman:\n\nKey to buying an over- 100,000 mile car is condition. Any car you are considering should be checked over by a mechanic NOT affiliated with the dealer you might buy from. At that kind of mileage, condition is more important than brand. Consider that cheaper models will get you a newer car within your budget and that can be a good thing given you only drive 6000 miles a year.\n\n\nYes!\nRather than focusing on a specific make and model, the OP should be searching for a vehicle that has been maintained flawlessly–or at least that has been maintained very well.    Even a make and model that has a history of very good reliability can become a money-pit of very high repair expenses if the previous owner(s) were lax with maintenance.\nA car that is being sold by an individual, rather than a dealership, has a decent chance of coming with maintenance records that can be compared to the vehicle mfr’s maintenance schedule.   When people buy my cars, not only do they get every maintenance invoice, but they also get a chart that I compiled, which allows me (and future owners) to see exactly what services were done, as well as the date and the odometer mileage of each service.\nBut, as Mustangman mentioned, even a car that looks good to you will need to be vetted by a mechanic of your own choosing.    You will likely pay ~$100 for that type of detailed pre-purchase inspection, so you will only want to take that extra step with a vehicle that you are sure that you want to buy.    A mechanic can detect collision damage that you might not have been able to see, as well as incipient mechanical problems, and can steer you away from a vehicle that would be a monetary risk for you.', 'What’s your budget?', 'Good advice! In addition, I would add that you buy a vehicle that’s common so that any repairs in the boondocks are easy and cheap!\nI have a friend in Houston, whose late father in law in Chicago  left him a Jaguar XJS, 12 cylinder model. He took a one way ticket to Chicago and a week later and $2400 in repairs, finally got the car home. He should have trailered it to Houston and then have it inspected!\nMy choice would be a Hyundai, Mazda 3 or similarly reliable vehicle with 50,000 or so miles on it. Age will determine what you pay. And by all means have a mechanic inspect it; Do this well in advance!\nUnder no circumstances buy a Volvo or similar expensive and troublesome vehicle.!', '\n\n\n Docnick:\n\nUnder no circumstances buy a Volvo or similar expensive and troublesome vehicle.!\n\n\nYup!\nAs I tell my friends and relatives, I owned a Volvo…ONCE…\n', 'The advice above is good. I’ll add that you’ll probably get more for your money with Kia or Hyundai over Toyota or Honda.', 'To people used to long trips, 1400 miles is not much, for almost any properly maintained car, with a very few bad brands excepted.\nMy daughter learned to do long trips. Her husband is very protective. So, the first time after they married, she wanted to drive a 3000 mile round trip to the Quad-Cities to visit Grandma, he freaked out a bit. For him, the roughly 200 miles to San Antonio was nearly a polar expedition. To her San Antonio was just the first restroom break.\nHe finally realized she had done it a number of times before they married. So he let her go and she had the usual great time.', 'Thanks for the advice! I do believe I have learned my lesson by buying that Volvo.  My budget is $10,000 or less, and I am looking for a 2011 or newer with lower than 100k miles based on my best financing option. I was looking for a Toyota, Honda, or Subaru because those cars are very common where I live (I always hear people say that Subarus are the state car of Utah, lol). True, 1400 miles is not that far, but I get the feeling that driving through the Mojave for hours takes a toll on a car, plus other random trips made to my in-laws’ place in middle-of-nowhere Nevada, 12 hours round trip. I also commute to neighboring cities every day, sometimes multiple times a day.\nI am glad to hear that the specific make matters less than I thought and to have a car checked at a mechanic before buying! I will be sure to do thorough research on each specific car I check out. This is my first time buying a car all by myself, as well as dealing with auto financing, so everyone’s input is much appreciated. ', 'I could recommend the car I use for long road trips, a 1998 Honda Civic with 280,000 miles on the odometer, but what I like probably isn’t the same thing you like.\nI like having a small fuel-efficient vehicle that I can use to pile on the miles without having to spend a lot on fuel.  I like the simplicity of a stick shift and roll-down windows.  I like that I know this car from fender to fender and can tell when something is wrong before it becomes a problem.\nBased on your last car, you probably value things like comfort, safety, and you probably wouldn’t be happy driving an 19-year-old economy car.  Therefore, I recommend you not ask strangers for their opinions about what they like, and focus on finding a car that suits your needs by perusing the latest Consumer Reports car buying guide, test driving the models that appeal to you, and then deciding for yourself.  If you don’t want to buy the latest Consumer Reports car buying guide, it might be available at your local library.', 'In this case, the decision is already made, but in general, spending more on a car than you could sell it for is not necessarily deal-breaker unless you plan on selling it immediately…    When you buy a new car, you typically invest $5000 more in the car than you could sell it for if you decide to sell it next week.  Why then, is it so scary to invest $1000 more in an old car than you could sell it for next week?   This is particularly true if you are replacing it with a used car with no warranty.  Even if the used car is late model and low miles, there is a reason why someone got rid of it, and you don’t know what that reason is.\nIn this particular case, if you have an S70 with the nicer, leather seats, there are no more comfortable seats anywhere, and lots of S70s ran beyond 300k miles.  They need headlight upgrades, and they have chronic steering rack and ABS problems, but once you sort those out, an S70 makes a great long distance cruiser.', '\n\n\n francomamanda:\n\nHello!

I’ve been wanting another pickup for awhile and I’m looking around at the current options.  I know it’s a tough time to be a buyer but the $25k-30k range doesn’t seem so bad to me.
At the Nissan dealership up the street a few miles away, they have a brand new 2020 Frontier King Cab V6, and at a used dealership about 130 miles away they have a 2017 Tacoma Access Cab with 50k miles and the 2.7L 4-cylinder engine.  Nissan is $29k, Toyota is $25k.  Both seem reasonable, but I’m not sure about the Nissan, having never owned or driven one before.  And the Tacoma is right around that sweet spot in age and mileage, it seems.
I don’t drive much more than about 6k miles per year so a low-mileage used truck is not a problem.

7,Is this 2007 Camry SE a good buy?,Buying/Selling,"['toyota', 'camry']",galant,"['kurious', 'COROLLAGUY1', 'VOLVO-V70', 'SteveCBT', 'Barkydog', 'weekend-warrior', 'Mustangman']","Hello,
Thank you in advance for your guidance.
We want to decide whether or not to buy a 2007 Camry SE. Following are the details:

Odometer reading: 127,200
Asking price: $5,000 (the seller found out about our budget through a mutual friend)
Location: Boston
4 previous owners
Checked Carfax and Autocheck reports. No accidents
KBB value for “fair” condition is $5,090.
Our budget is $5,000 meant to be for car + repairs. Can do + or - $500.
I and DW are very new drivers and this will be our first car. The primary use will be to gain experience driving and gradually go on inter-state trips

In the pre-purchase inspection at a mechanic, 3 issues were identified:

Rack and pinion need repair - Estimated $800-$1,200
Stabilizer links on both sides need to be repaired - $125 each
Airbag might need reprogramming (Snap on computer code :B1650 Occupant Classifying System). Might need to involve dealership. At high end, the price might get as high as $1,000


In addition, they expect the exhaust pipe/rear axle between mufflers to need replacement in 1-2 years. It could cost up to 1,000 depending on the extent of replacement necessary. I am a car noob. I thus don’t remember the part exactly but do remember the price!

Some good things:

For a 14yo car, it seems to have lower (127k) than average (143k) mileage
The original parts have not been replaced
No issues reported with the engine and the transmission
I was concerned about the infamous Toyota oil leak issue but that does not seem to have afflicted this car

I have the following questions:


Based on the information above, I am unwilling to pay $5k for the car. The max I am willing to spend is $3,200 although that figure could change a bit based on your feedback. If the seller doesn’t agree, I plan to walk away. Is this car worth buying for $3200? Is it worth buying for more or less?


Are there other factors that I need to consider?


Thank you once again for your guidance.

I am not familiar with the process of getting out of a lease early. So my current car lease is $600/mo and I have paid 16 mo of it, so 20 more months remaining, which I still owe $12000 to the dealer.
Carvarna offers $50000 - 12000 (lease payoff amount) = $38000 would be the payment to me.
Kelly Blue Book Instant Cash offer is $49500 because it didn’t ask me if my car was own or lease.
Let’s say the residual value of the leased car is $32000, plus $12000 I still owe, I would have to pay the current dealer $47000 to buyout. I could accept Kelly’s offer, take the $49500, they get the car. I pay back the current dealer and make $2500.
But I don’t understand why Carvarna deducts the $12000, that they would take over the lease? All i need to do is to take their $38000 net offer, pay the current dealer the residual value of the car, and make $6000? i am so confused. Any idea?

15,Recommendations on a vehicle - beach,Buying/Selling,[],andrew_174859,"['VOLVO-V70', 'ledhed75', 'weekend-warrior', 'texases', 'shadowfax', 'Mustangman']","Hey gang!
I’m looking for recommendations on my next vehicle.
I currently drive a 2020 Subaru Outback with 15,000 miles. I added options when I purchased it and got it at a sweet deal with 0% financing. I owe roughly 15k left.
I just moved Charleston, SC and conveniently live within walking distance to my new office.
The Subaru was purchased in 2020 as a car that will be a daily driver with quite a substantial number of miles added to it daily with commuting.
It serves a great purpose to an extent. I love the car as a city car. I love the AWD and road trip capabilities. I love the adaptive cruise control, huge 12” touch screen display, and all the electronics it has to offer.
However…
It doesn’t necessarily serve my purpose. I’m 6’3” and getting in and out can be a pain. The doors constantly need to be wiped because of dirt buildup. I have a laundry list of complaints, but my main focus is needing a “beach” car. I’m not concerned about gas mileage or needing a family car (no kids and walk everywhere). My focus is on a car that I can take my dogs to the beach and not worry how dirty it gets. It’ll be a daily driver too.
Because of that, I’ve been looking at a Jeep Wrangler and Toyota Tacoma. I’ve owned both a wrangler and truck in the past. I loved how easy the Jeep is to clean, and being in a sandy area, that’s perfect. The manual is fun to drive, and I’m not doing but 5-10 miles a day max. I’ve also owned a Tacoma. I enjoyed the truck and their engines are incredible.
With that being said, what does the community recommend?
Budget is sub 30k. I’ve been targeting 2016-2019 wranglers and Tacoma’s.
It will be a daily driver but I will not be driving much if any each day.
The main driving I do is to the grocery store, restaurants, and then wherever I take my dogs (beaches, parks, etc).
I’m tall as I mentioned before so I do miss sitting up high.
What does the community think? Let’s hear some recommendations and feedback!

20,Is new Mustangs (2021) handling really this bad?,Buying/Selling,['ford'],Nevada_545,"['VOLVO-V70', 'VDCdriver', 'lapsio3_173722', 'Bing', 'Purebred', 'Cavell', 'texases', 'Mustangman', 'jtsanders']","Hi
I’m currently looking for some “real deal” sports car and it came to my attention that… There’s not many of them out there tbh. I was looking specifically for:

legit 2 door coupe (specifically 2+2 seats config)
manual transmission
RWD
sold in Europe, new
NOT German
(somewhat) affordable

Those are hard requirements. After some light research I realized that in current market dominated by regular boring cars in glorified trims attempting to make them a bit less boring (like BMW M, Audi RS, Ford ST etc.), one of VERY few cars that match all criteria is Ford Mustang.
Unfortunately I’m a bit more into cornering than straight line acceleration so I immediately got worried about Mustang bad handling reputation and general clumsiness. The only versions available in my country are V8 GT and V8 Mach 1 (EU spec, equivalent of Mach 1 PP1 in US, not possible to get PP2) so I’m only considering Mach 1 as of now. To US people I’d like to mention that Mustangs in EU are actually quite expensive and for example such Mach 1 costs here around 65k usd (80k usd incl. tax) so it’s not really “bargain” and it actually scratches top of my budget for car.
So with all that in mind - is this bad reputation still true for 2021 Mustang GT with Magnet Ride suspension, especially Mach 1 variant? I know it’s heavy but… so is Nissan GT-R for example. Yet still it’s regarded as “supercar killer”. It seems to me really weird and counter intuitive that car so expensive, with such giant and actually decent tires could handle worse than eg. BRZ. Even considering lower weight. Because from all this hate train in the internet I got impression that Mustang handles worse than anything else on this planet including significantly cheaper cars… So is it really this bad or is it just some burden that follows new Mustangs because old ones were crappy and had solid rear axle?
I mean it’s not like I’m gonna take this thing on track day every weekend but I don’t want to feel like I’m driving a bus either… I’m perfectly aware that German cars would handle better due to all those electronics etc but like I said I don’t want German car so it’s not really my goal. Still I’d probably be a bit disappointed if it’d come sideways at speeds where waaay cheaper cars like BRZ wouldn’t even sweat cornering stock-vs-stock.

Before I also (strongly) considered BRZ but it’s no longer sold here. All other cars that I like fail in at least one or more criteria (Supra, MX-5, Alpine A110, Cayman and few others) and like I said those are hard requirements, so I’m really struggling to even find any alternatives apart from similar cars like Camaro and Challenger (which probably handle even worse and don’t look all that appealing to me)…","['Only you can decide if you like the handling.

But it’s not rocket science to deduce that any car even remotely considered “sports car” will be better in every aspect. I have not driven sufficient number of sports cars to properly judge Mustang performance in big picture, even if I’ve driven one now. It’s going to be my first “proper” RWD sports car. However I’m kind of person who gets really attached to things emotionally. So unless I crash it on first tree near Ford dealership, I’ll probably keep this cars for many years to come. That’s also why I’m looking for 2+2, not purely 2 seats car since it significantly reduces probability that I’ll have to change it any soon due to severe practicality issues. I believe it may actually be my first and the only sports car I will ever buy in my life since it’s young people thing to get cars like those.

Also yeah, it’s gonna be my daily.\nNot trying many cars is also why I’m mostly seeking for opinions in the internet hoping that there’s someone who had opportunity to drive way more cars than I did and could comment on that matter having several years of experience. Since it’s long term purchase I want it to be good and give me joy for years to come. Realizing after 2 years that “damn this thing drives like brick” would be far from optimal. But so would be deciding after 2 years that “damn this thing totally lacks power” if I got eg. BRZ  (which sounds likely considering that my current car has 2x more torque than BRZ, around the same power, about the same weight and it feels slow af). So it’s though decision for me.\nThat’s also why I didn’t ask on Mustang related forums because it was obvious that everyone here would tell me how wonderful this car is, including people who never had any other car and  have no idea how it compares.\nMustang sounds like really versatile car that gives a bit of everything - a bit of power, a bit of practicality, a bit of sliding fun due to rwd and looks good.

I need to get my 19year old daughter a “new” used car. Her current 2005 Subaru Impreza is at 180k and is destined to be her 16 year old brother’s first ride.
It is a stick shift and if possible, we want to continue buying stick shifts for our kids. (Easy anti-theft, extra driving cred among peers, also requires more attention to driving and commitment to learning about the car, imho).
The horrific accident videos in Fort Worth last week have me obsessed about safety. (I know, I know, why wasn’t it the #1 priority before…well,  stupid me, but anyway, that’s all that’s in my head right now.) I was looking at another subcompact, maybe a Kia Soul or Mazda 3, they’re both sticks. But I’m worried and I know statistically I should worry about everything else other than a monster crash like last week. I guess it’s just human nature. Can’t get the videos out of my head. The SUVs and pickups I saw seemed to do much better in the aftermath; the sedans were what I saw in tiny crushed pieces.
I’m sorry to be so nervous. I have a bit of trauma left over from a crash of my own and that’s not helping me.
Long-winded way of saying: what’s my best bet for a safe and reliable stick shift that has some heft around the gear stick?
Our budget was $5k cash but now I’m ready to take out a car loan for twice that or even more to get something safe.
Thanks for any and all advice.","['I can’t agree that a manual transmission is best for a young driver besides there are so few being made now that the resale of a manual is low.  Best for a young driver ? Almost any decent vehicle made in the last 20 years except high powered sports type .\nAlso if the owner becomes ill the chance of their passenger being able to drive them home in a manual is low.  The main safety factor is the driver .', 'Our daughter picked out a used soul, she is happy with it. 2020 is highly rated, you would have to check the year you are looking at.', 'Let’s not kid ourselves here.  The most important “safety feature” of any car isn’t assembled at the factory–it’s the person driving the car.  If you pay attention and drive with common sense, even a 20 or 30 year old car can be as safe as anything else on the road (assuming the car is in decent condition).  If you fail to wear your seat belt, drive aggressively, play with your cellphone while driving, fail to anticipate what other drivers will do, even the latest and greatest new model will be a death trap.\nWhen I started driving, everyone I knew started out with an economy car from the 1980s to early 1990s (this was in 1996 btw).  Cellphones did not exist back then, and we survived with minimal “safety features” by exercising reasonable caution and common sense.  Now I am not suggesting you buy your kid a 28 year old Ford Tempo or a 30 year old Dodge Shadow, but I would argue that anything made in the decade from 1999 to 2009 is plenty safe, as well as affordable to buy and maintain.\nI would also recommend buying something with an automatic transmission.  There is really no benefit to driving a stick-shift on anything other than a sports car, which would not be good for a young person anyways.', 'Larger is safer. If safety is top on your list I’d go up a size, to Camry/Accord.', 'Agree.  There is no “safe” vehicle for a teenager but the best safety feature is the driver.  You can only hope when they put it in the ditch, hit the tree, or tip it over, they will be wearing their seat belt and not be injured.  (You may not find out about this until years later.)  Also disagree on the transmission.  My Morris and VW were manuals as a teenager but automatics after that.  I really see absolutely no difference but if anything, having to coordinate the clutch and gear shift detracts from watching the road.  Good point on theft though and the recent rash of car jackings.  Around here they are working ing teams of 2-4 where one person will rob the driver and the other will steal the car.  You’d still get robbed or shot but the car would be OK.', 'Thief can’t drive a manual so he might not be able to steal it but he might be annoyed enough to slash tires or some other kind of damage .

I’ve had three auto trannys go on me (two Chevys and one Toyota, fwiw.) I think manuals are more long-lived as long as the driver isn’t a clutch mangler. Plus, I’ve pop-started a ton of cars that I wouldn’t have been able to get running again to get to the repair shop if they’d been autos.\nBut I will agree that it makes for a harder search. Resale doesn’t matter to us; we drive all our cars to the death. Our newest current car is a 2010.\nAnd yes, obviously the driver is the most important factor. But all those sitting ducks being slammed into last week by 18-wheelers couldn’t drive their way out of it.  Hence my search for something that might give my kid a better chance of survivability in the worst-case scenario.\nSo I’m not getting the sense that anyone here thinks any car is more safe than another, just maybe the size?

I am looking for a new VW Bug after my trusty 2001 gave out after >220,000 miles. I found the perfect replacement through Craigslist: a 2006 model, no visible rust, priced around $4,000 with a clean Carfax.
However, when I called to inquire about the vehicle, the seller told me that there had been a break-in the night before, the car’s catalytic converter had been stolen, and they were taking it in to get a new one. I left my name and number and told him I’m still interested in seeing the car, and to call me after the repair is done to set up a test drive.
This raises two questions for me which I’m hoping to get your feedback on:

Paranoid question: Is this some sort of scheme to justify inflating the car’s price? (sub question: if the seller raises the car’s price because of this repair, is that justified or should I push back? Could this be a red flag about the seller?)
Less paranoid question: Will the theft and subsequent work to replace the catalytic converter in any way affect the future running of the car?

All best,
M","['\nI doubt it.\nI doubt this will adversely affect the value, and may enhance it a little. Since the loss was by theft, the owner will likely have it covered by insurance.

Also, 2WD only with the 4-cyl. It’ll be a pig with 4WD.', 'I am going to go against the grain here.  While a Toyota Tacoma is a great truck, on the used market they are grossly overpriced.  It is not uncommon to see a 20 year old Tacoma for sale with over 250,000 miles, and people still want $5k to $6k for it.  For that kind of money, you could buy a newer Ford or Chevrolet with less than half the miles.\nThe best “bang for the buck” in compact pickups (assuming you live in a region where rust is not a problem) would be a Ford Ranger or Chevrolet S10 from the late 1990s to early 2000s.  I see them for sale all the time, in excellent condition with relatively low miles for under $3k.  Around here, you can’t even touch a Tacoma for that, unless it was damaged in an accident, has over 300,000 miles, or needs the engine replaced.', '\n\n\n Eric14:\n\nits cheap on gas\n\n\nDepends on what you consider “cheap on gas”\nThe 2WD model get’s about 19MPG city and 25 MPG highway, the 4WD model does 17 and 22 respectively.   For a truck, that’s not bad. For all cars/trucks in general, it’s merely okay, with the 4WD model being particularly unimpressive in that you’re giving up significant capability for not much gain in fuel economy vs. larger more powerful trucks. Vs. a V8 4WD F-150 or Silverado of the same vintage, you’re getting about  1 MPG better with the 2.7L 4WD Tacoma.\n\n\n\n Eric14:\n\n, is it reliable\n\n\nTacos have a reputation for reliability,  paper mache frames notwithstanding.\n\n\n\n Eric14:\n\ndoes it worth it?\n\n\nIs it worth it?  I’m of the opinion that Tacos are about the most reliable trucks you can get. However I’ve never bought one, because I don’t feel that their value proposition is particularly good. And I generally buy full-sized trucks for that reason. I feel you get more for your money with full-sized trucks.  But I know plenty of people with Tacomas and they all seem to have high opinions of them.', 'Yes, Toyota has admitte3d to this defect. My son’s Tacoma will get  a new frame covered under their warranty.', 'Need a 4x4 for winter season when roads are discusting other than that its will be on 2wd need is just tool box and misc', '\n\n\n Eric14:\n\nNeed a 4x4 for winter season when roads are discusting\n\n\nThis is a myth.  When I started driving, in 1996, 4-wheel drive was uncommon even on trucks.  And I grew up in Illinois, so plenty of experience with winter driving.  The truth is that 4-wheel drive is unnecessary, and actually gives people a false sense of confidence when they would be better off to stay home or find a different route.\nIf the roads are truly icy or snowy or flooded to the point that a reasonable person would doubt their ability to safely proceed in a FWD economy car, then the danger level is too high, even if you are driving a 4WD pickup or SUV.  If having 4WD will make you take trips during harsh winter weather or attempt to cross flooded roads which you’d otherwise not do, then it is an impediment to your safety, not a benefit.\nAs another person already mentioned, 4WD brings a huge fuel economy penalty versus 2WD.  It also makes it more difficult and expensive to replace tires, since all four must be identical.  On a 2WD vehicle, tires can be replaced in pairs, or if funds are really tight, just one tire can be replaced as long as the non-identical tires are on the undriven axle.', 'If you want 4WD, take one with the 4-cyl for a long drive in the conditions you usually drive in, and see if you still want it. Comparing to the 6-cyl version by test driving it too can help you make a decision.', 'Gonna have to disagree. I drove a 2WD 1974 F-100 (390, 3 speed manual, 4.11 gears, manual steering, manual brakes), during the blizzard of 1996.  It was a chore. 17 year old me slid off the road twice (but managed to extricate myself both times), during that week.  Fast forward 5 years and I was driving a 1995 Bronco, 4WD with a rear LSD.  We get another foot of snow, and the Bronco handles it much, much better,  sure-footed as a mountain goat. Every truck I’ve gotten since then has been 4WD.  4WD is one of those things that you don’t need most of the time, but when you do need it, it’s invaluable.\nThe fuel economy argument varies from vehicle to vehicle; on the Taco there’s a pretty big swing, the reason for this is not just the 4WD system, 2WD Tacos and 4WD Tacos are built differently,  more so than any other truck (as far as the differences between the 2WD and 4WD variants of the same model go).  The 4WD frame is beefier, and the suspension on the 4WD is much heavier as well. The 4WD version can be  900 pounds heavier than the 2WD version (for the 2010 model year),  which accounts for alot of the MPG difference.  Most other compact/mid-sized trucks don’t have that much variation in weight when you go from 2WD to 4WD. The new Ranger for example only gains about 500 pounds. When you go from a base 2WD to a loaded 4WD model.  In most cases going from a 2WD model to a 4WD model of the same truck with the same drivetrain will lose you 1 or 2 MPG overall. It’s a not a huge penalty in most cases.\nAs for tires; if you’re rotating them like you should be, then they should be pretty close wear-wise.  On my 4WD vehicles, certainly I’ve had tires that were worn somewhat more than others, but not to the point where I thought that I was gaining anything by not replacing all four.  Like two might’ve been a 3/32’s and the other two might’ve been 4/32’s. I might’ve been able to eek out another 1500 miles before replacing the better tires, but it wouldn’t be worth the hassle vs. just getting all four replaced right then and there.   Also  part time 4WD systems are tolerant of differing amounts of tire wear.  That’s not going to hurt anything.  4WD isn’t the same as AWD, there’s no center diff metering out how much power goes where. it’s a 50/50 split, and since you only use 4WD on slippery/forgiving surfaces there’s enough slipping involved so that the fractions of an inch of difference in tire diameter is a non-factor.\nAnother benefit of 4WD is that everyone thinks they need it. So 4WD vehicles maintain their value better. When I traded in my 1997 F-150 a few years back. I was assuming I was going to get $1000 for it or near-scrap value as it was rusted out to the point where it was going to be marginal if it was going to be able to pass inspection next time around.  And it was a 20 year old truck.  I was surprised when I was offered $3500 trade in for it. The salesman said that it was working, very low mileage (for the year) 4WD truck, and they they could ship it up north and get over $5k for it at the minimum. But if were a 2WD truck, they would’ve either declined the trade or given me $1000 for it.', '\n\n\n FoDaddy:\n\nGonna have to disagree.

The truth is that 4-wheel drive is unnecessary, and actually gives people a false sense of confidence when they would be better off to stay home or find a different route.\n\n\nAnd the snowiest section in Illinois is less then 1/5th the amount of snow in the town I grew up in. So I wouldn’t say the 4wd or even AWD is unnecessary. It really depends on where you live. Especially in areas that see a lot of Lake Effect snow.\nHere in southern NH we average about 50""/yr…And 4wd isn’t needed. My wife gets by easily with her 07 Lexus and good All-Season tires.

Specifically, I want non-powered windows and seats, no sunroof/moonroof, no alarm or immobilizer system, no touch screens, no “drive by wire” throttle body, no electric power steering, and nothing which communicates wirelessly with a remote server or acts to override the driver’s inputs.
I also need this car to be easy enough to work on that I could perform routine maintenance and even many kinds of repairs myself at home using a floor jack, jack stands, and standard tools.  By “easy enough”, I mean that this car should be no more difficult than say a 4-cylinder Caravan/Voyager or Spirit/Acclaim to do things such as replace the timing belt kit, replace the water pump, replace the radiator and coolant hoses, replace the accessory belt(s) and tensioner(s), replace the spark plugs and ignition wires, change the transmission fluid and filter, replace gaskets and seals, etc.  So no multiple timing chains, no unreasonably difficult timing belts, and no internal water pump driven by a timing chain.

29,Help finding replacement vehicle,Buying/Selling,['mazda'],remodeler,[],"First let me say I don’t know which heading to put this under, so I chose this one.  I may choose another also in case this isn’t the right place.
I HATE that my car is apparently on its last legs.  I LOVE my 2005 Mazda 6 wagon w/88k miles.  Just had it looked at and there’s an oil leak somewhere in the engine that they can’t get the gasket for because Mazda doesn’t make it anymore,  and I’m told even if they could find one at a salvage/junk yard there’s no guarantee that it’s not dried out and would also leak, seeing as it’s also been sitting in a 16 yr old car.  I’m told it will last a while longer (no estimate on that though) but I should start looking for something else now.  I was even willing to have the engine rebuilt (that’s how much I love this thing) but again, there’s the same problem of parts (gaskets) that can’t be found new, and the cost to get an engine with 16 yr old parts plus the install would cost a lot.  So I need to find something else.
Problem is I absolutely hate the new(er) cars with all the technology and crummy air vents (one of the best things about my wagon - they’re round and can hit ANY part of your body, not like the terrible rectangle vents in every car that can only go up/down/left/right).  Everything is an SUV.  I’m short - 5’2.  They don’t make cars for us.  I pretty much need a step to get into any SUV.  On top of which I have a chronic foot injury and stepping on something, like a running board, to get myself into the seat hurts.  The technology drives me crazy with the nav screen and beeping because of SOMEthing, backup camera, etc.  Plus, not ONE has the cargo space that mine has. (I was once told by a number of dealers that in order to get the cargo space that I have, they’d have to sell me a van.  I don’t want a van. Or even a minivan).
I like plain and simple.  Don’t need all the doodads.  Would prefer a wagon, used would be better - don’t really want to spend $30k+ (or even $20k+) for new - but would consider looking at new despite the doodads and price if I have to.  Since I’ve been driving a 16 yr old car I have no clue what to look at, which is what I need help with.  Don’t know anyone who’s car savvy that I can ask.
So…after all that, can anyone help by directing me to what I can/should look at as far as used or new cars that are reliable?  I’ve looked online but there’s so many that I need to narrow it down because I have to actually physically go look at them and try them to see if I like them and they work for me (and my issues) and with chronic pain that will take a good amount of time.
I have 2 basic needs: something relatively close to the ground because of my foot injury (nothing I have to climb into) and preferably with good cargo space even if I have to fold seats down.  I don’t need nor want big 5-7 passenger vehicles (no kids) just to get the cargo space.

I am about to buy my first car (new driver) and I am looking for some advice.
It will mainly be used for (in the same order):
1st motorway transport
2nd driving around town
3rd Weekend trips
The roads in the country i’m moving in will be fairly rough (cracked pavements etc.)
For now, I have focused on the following characteristics:
Transmission: Manual transmission
Manufacturers: Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Mazda
Year of production: around 2010
Budget: 4-5k euro (including repairs)
I am wondering about the following questions

Which characteristics are most important in my situation? (economy, power, handling, safety, etc …)
What is your opinion about the models below?
Can you recommend something better?

Thanks and happy holidays!
Viewed Models:
Toyota Corolla
Honda Accord
Mazda 6
Toyota Rav4
Honda Civic
Toyota Camry
VW Passat
is it even worth looking at things like this for my price range  :
Mazda MX-5","['My suggestion is to eliminate the Passat from your list.  VWs have a much worse reliability record than any of the Japanese models that you listed, and a 10 year old VW will likely need a lot of expensive repairs over the next few years.\nAlso, make sure that any of the Toyotas you are looking at are model year 2010 or newer.  For a couple of years (2008-2009 IIRC), their four cylinder engines were manufactured with defective piston rings, and those engines consume a LOT of oil.', 'This is mostly a US forum site and since you may be in the United Kingdom you may have models we have no knowledge of.  Simply put find what you might want a pay a shop to look it over before  you buy it and check if the selling dealer will offer some kind of warranty.  If you buy from an individual you will have no recourse after purchase .  You are buying a used vehicle so it has to stand on it’s own as to how good it is.  Do you not have a relative or friend to at least go with you that might see that you should consider or pass.', 'Concur on the Passat. VW’s are less reliable than the other brands you mentioned no matter what country you’re in.\nOnly you can tell what characteristics are most important to you. There is a lot of difference between some of your models (Camry vs Miata, for instance), so you might want to figure out what kind of vehicle you want before you start looking at specific models.', 'I have to wonder about the manual transmission on the list. I know that manuals are more common in Europe but it also a fact that a new driver can destroy a clutch in a very short time . Plus that leaves some very good automatic vehicles off the list.', 'You have too wide of a range of choices.  If you want lowest cost balanced with highest reliability, it would be better to have a newer Corolla than an older Rav4, for example.\nI also agree that if you are a newer driver on rougher roads, an automatic might be best for a first car.  Then save your money for an older MX-5 manual, just for fun.', 'Decide what is important to you. If you want a lot of room for cargo, consider an SUV like the RAV4. You might also consider the Mazda CX-5 and Honda CRV if they are available where you will live. If you want a sedan or coupe, determine the size and fuel mileage you want. Fuel is so expensive in Europe that this will be more important than in the USA, where most of us live. Another issue is highway speeds. If there are unlimited speeds on the highways you will drive, make sure the car can handle that. Since you mentioned poor road conditions, my guess is you will more likely be in Eastern Europe. Consider whether the car you get will be easily repaired in your new home. You don’t want to buy a good brand just to find out there are almost none there.\nAlso it’s useful to know that while a VW is less reliable than a Toyota, that doesn’t make it unreliable. If you like a car and the price is great, consider it even if it is from a traditional European manufacturer. At 5000€, it must be used, and you should have a mechanic you trust give it a prepurchase inspection.', 'Your budget is VERY tight, you’ll need to see what’s available, take the best vehicle you can find in your price range.', 'Given the poor roads I’d lean toward the Rav4. In the end, though, it’s going to come down to the best vehicle for the money and your budget is very tight.']",6,410

I believe the year was 2006 or 2007 (I would have to view the Bill of Sales) my grandfather, who passed away in 2008, signed a bill of sale for several vehicles he either owned, or had possession of, to me. These vehicles included a 1963 Chevrolet C10, a 1972 Dodge Dart Custom, and a 1977 Oldsmobile Delta 88. I know for a fact the '63 Chevy belonged to my grandfather. I think the '72 Dodge belonged to his mother originally and no one wanted it so he came to collect it, and the '77 Oldsmobile belonged to my grandmother, (his wife.) I still have the Bill of Sales to these vehicles. They are all junk vehicles (really hate calling them that) or vehicles I would like to restore. I never had a place to take them to before, or the means to do it until recently. As if things weren’t complicated enough, someone illegally obtained his land, then turned around and sold it. The vehicles, all except the '63 Chevy, are gone. Am I within right to contact the police about the '72 Dodge and '77 Oldsmobile so that I can reclaim them? I personally know the person that owns the land now and am going to ask about the '63 Chevy and my dad had a truck on that land that is in his name and will be reported as stolen so that it can be found. I am just curious about all of this because I plan on letting the guy know that I have a bill of sale for the '63 Chevy, and if I can I’d like to recover these old vehicles that belonged, or were maybe passed down through my family. If anyone can give me guidance on this subject I would greatly appreciate it, and I know not to have a lot of hope on this matter. I wouldn’t be surprised if every vehicle, except the '63 Chevy, was scrap metal by now. I appreciate the input and guidance. If there are any other questions I will do my best to answer them as quickly as possible. Thank you.","['This is really a legal question not a car question so you really need legal guidance.  I’m not sure how someone illegally obtains the land though and then is able to sell it.  Maybe they sold it with just a quit claim deed so really the new owner has nothing, I dunno.  I do think though that you had some duty to take possession of the cars as all this was going on or to at least inform whoever was occupying the land that they were yours or they could have been considered abandoned.  But yeah, you need a lawyer and also need to discuss this with whoever the executor was of your grandfather’s estate.', 'I second Bings advice, this is a legal question so you need an attorney but climbing out on a limb …\n\nIf you have a clean Bill of Sale for the Chevy and you know where it is, reclaiming it should be nothing more than presenting your proof of ownership to the holder and towing it away.\nThere’s a legal procedure for disposing of abandoned property which generally results in the car being scrapped. If you have the time, money and want to make the effort you can generally track the paperwork to see if it was properly done and where it went to…\nAgain, if you have proof of ownership you can certainly file a stolen property report with the police but again, if it was legally transferred you may not be able to reclaim it.\n\nAnd for a dose of reality, time and weather aren’t friendly to a car left sitting for years and a proper restoration is expensive, frequently exceeding the value of the car so don’t get your hopes too high.', 'Why would someone think that anything from unknown persons on a Forum would be useful in this legal question ?', 'I agree. This is a legal matter that likely varies state by state. I would think that a lawyer might not charge more than a few hundred bucks for a brief consultation on applicable laws and then contact the police if possible.\nIf that Dart is a 2 Door then that would bug me to no end. Mopars are pretty collectible and can bring a bit of money. The Chevy too.\nHere in OK, the legal owner of the property can have an abandoned vehicle towed off of their property if the vehicle has been abandoned more than 48 hours. However, that vehicle cannot be removed until a number of legal hoops are jumped through. Forms in quadruplicate with the state, land owner, towing company, etc. I’m sure every state has bureaucratic rules in place and a lawyer, and police, could sort this out.\nIf they screwed up illegally and scrapped the vehicles your only option might be a civil suit.', 'I was a lawyer for years and years, and occasionally people would come to me with stories like this one.  I’d listen to them for a while, ask some questions, and then tell them that I couldn’t do much.  You have waited too long to do anything unless you have some way to prove ownership.  A Bill of Sale to you isn’t proof.  The State has rules and you never “perfected title”.  And how is anyone to know if the bill of sale is actually signed by your grandfather?  It’s for these reasons that States have laws to regulate and apply order to the ownership of vehicles.   In addition, are you really saying that waiting 13 or 14 years to try and get this truck isn’t just too long?  I think you abandoned it long ago.\nThe land problem is even sketchier because transfers of ownership of land have to be in writing and have to be recorded in official records.  Transfers because of death are probate matters and either they happen or they don’t.  If you never got title, it’s likely never been yours to dispute.  And if you waited 12 years to ask this question a court is gong to wonder what took so long.', '\n\n\n wentwest:\n\nAnd if you waited 12 years to ask this question a court is gong to wonder what took so long.\n\n\nBeyond just the judge “wondering”, don’t you think that he/she would likely apply the principle of Laches and refuse to even hear the case?', 'And there is also the Statue of Limitations which I believe to be in most states 2 to 3 years or so and the issue of what happened to the titles along with why was this not spelled out in a will.\nA legal fight could easily cost more than what the cars are worth though.\nIf the Dart was a 4 door I’d probably throw in the towel…   ', 'It was just something I was putting up for discussion is all. Thanks.\nJust to answer a few questions. When these vehicles were signed over to me I didn’t have a place to put them. My grandfather and step-grandmother lived together and on the same property. When he passed, naturally the land went to her, as it should have. She was ok with the vehicles being there. A “friend” of hers got power of attorney over her, durable POA for her money, non-durable POA for assets, lands, and other valuables. Long story short, the “friend” took most, if not all, of her money, to go on trips out of country and do what she wanted to do. It got to the point where my step-grandmother was running down the street in her underwear screaming for help in the middle of the night. Finally, the lady had my step-grandmother put in a home or hospital and never let any of us know. We had no idea she was that bad off, or what had even happened to her. The friend then signed over the two pieces of property to herself and that was that. I’m assuming someone thought she had a durable POA or no one knew my step-grandmother was deemed mentally incompetent, and yes, an investigation was done into her stare of mind and at the time those lands were sold she was deemed so. I reached out to the lady to speak about the vehicles and she never replied to.me.or anything. Then she sold the land for $40,000 to another person.\nThankfully, I know the person and he may have the vehicles. I am going to speak with him, but that is the reason why there was so much time had passed. If I were even able to recover them and restore them at this point, it would be a labor of love. It would be about honoring family through a skill or trade that applies to what was once theirs. It never has been about how much they were worth in dollars.\nI agree that this was a better legal question than one for an automobile forum, but sadly on any forum you run into the same problem. People want to belittle you for asking a question, or for things they don’t know, and rather than ask they just put you down and knock you down lower. It was one of the reasons why I was hesitant to even post this here in the first place.\nP.s. The Dart is a 4 door, haha, but it has a 318 in it and those are good motors. ', 'As far as I know, a bill of sale doesn’t help anything. The title of the vehicle is what proves ownership. Without a state title, there’s no way to prove that the cars were grandpa’s to sell in the first place. But I’m a mechanic, not a lawyer.', 'You grandfather’s wife probably found the vehicle titles and sold the vehicles. If there were no titles you can’t claim these vehicles. If the person that possess the truck has a title you might consider making an offer to purchase it, as it sits you have no legal right to it.\nAs for the real estate, the proceeds likely went to pay for the nursing home care, she can’t (unknowingly) gift her property to someone and have the government pay for these expenses.', 'Well not to drift away from cars but this is a good lesson for all.  If you give away POA be very careful who it goes to.  My Dad’s lawyer told me later that that’s why he gave me POA and not my sister.  He trusted me to carry out his wishes.  When selling his house though I needed to provide a copy of the POA to verify I had authority to sign.  What a tangled web.  Gauls me to no end that someone would do this to someone else.', 'Many early 70’s Darts were junk when new.', 'If you thought they were trash, why want them back?', 'The reasons why I would like them back is because of my grandfather wanting them to go to me/signing over the vehicles to me and also that they were family vehicles and I’m extremely interested in vehicles. I’m wanting to go to school to become a mechanic and welder. I ultimately want to restore old vehicles and have a shop of my own one day, but I figured it would be really cool to restore these old vehicles that my family used to own.', 'I know for a fact she never even cared about the vehicles. As far as the real estate goes, actually the lady went to my step-grandmother and told her she needed to sell her house and other property because “the state was trying to take it.” She then “sold” it to herself, and in turn sold one piece to someone, and pocketed $40,000 off of it and kept the other piece.', 'Well good luck but I really think you need to have a conversation with a lawyer and I’m not sure that should be the last stop.  People have a duty to keep the best interest of the people they represent in mind.  This sounds like it crossed over into the area of fraud and elder abuse and I think the lawyer should at least have a conversation with the DA.\nI forget the details and I was already retired but a guy I had worked with had the same relationship with his mother as she required care.  Only problem was he wrote checks to himself as payment for services.  His sister turned him in and he did avoid jail time but is now a felon.

I guess it looks that way from the outside looking in, but after a few years I learned that, no matter what people think should happen, it rarely does without setting things up carefully and clearly.

Also, I sometimes see people post a car for sale at a super-generous price because they want the car gone so they can stop paying insurance for it, or simply have nowhere to park it.\nThe point that I am making is that using Craigslist ads as a method of valuing a car for sale could lead to a very incorrect assessment of what the car is worth.  A pricing guide such as KBB will give a reasonable range based on the equipment level, mileage, and condition of the car you’re looking at.', 'I was working off what Autotempest pulled up from Cars.com and the other sites within the Seattle/Tacoma market for these cars. Don’t know what these are actually going for though.', 'The range is listed because used cars sellers have different expectations for price and the urgency of the sale. Also, the listed condition may not be the real condition. Brakes and tire are often ignored when the owner assesses the condition, and replacing brake pads and tires is a big part of the sales price on an older car.\nIf I’m looking at used car prices, I value the car in near perfect condition given it’s age (near perfect body and paint, no replacement parts needed), then start subtracting for any work needed. If it needs new tires, knock off about $600, new brakes all around maybe $500. You have time to check this car out since a friend owns it. Get it checked by a mechanic you trust, including cost to fix anything it needs. Since this is a friend, you might share how you came to the offer you make.', 'My sis just sold her Avalon.

Then start deducting based on how much it would cost me to repair whatever flaws I deem important enough to fix, then base my offer on that, being as transparent to the seller as possible. This applies to both private party and dealer sales.', 'like that methodology', 'likewise here.

38,Do i need a subwoofer or is just a CD enough?,Buying/Selling,[],galant,"['eddo', 'texases', 'MikeInNH', 'VOLVO-V70', 'tcmichnorth', 'B.L.E', 'VDCdriver', 'FoDaddy', 'oldtimer_11', 'tomerfish333_172658', 'keith', 'shadowfax']","So I bought new speakers for my car (Citroen C4 2007) rear and front.
My current CD is old and doesn’t have an AUX input nor Bluetooth so I can’t really play music from my phone/Spotify.

I looked at the internet and found a pretty nice CD (I think?) its called Nakamichi NQ711B.
It has a microphone, AUX, Bluetooth, USB, and an app to control the bass, vol, etcetera… It costs much less but I wonder… Will my audio experience decreases if I won’t get the more expensive CD? If no is there a reason to buy an expensive CD? And if just a cheap CD but also a good subwoofer is what I need?","['I was surprised to see that Nakamichi sells for about $50.  Nakamichi used to be a very high-end brand.  No longer - like Dual, it is now used for ultra-cheap electronics.  I don’t think any $50 head unit would be considered ‘good’, especially if it has all those inputs/outputs.  It can’t have much power, and clean, wide frequency response power is important to avoid distortion.  I’d plan on spending $150 or more.', 'Cheap radio head units will be cheap in quality (possibly in sound quality, most definitely in build quality,) but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the most expensive will be the best in your situation.\ndo some research- read head unit reviews on crutchfield.com, on Amazon.com, on Citroen forums, and then decide what you are after compared to what your wallet can afford and what is practical for your car.', '\n\n\n texases:\n\nNakamichi used to be a very high-end brand. No longer\n\n\nYeah. Sad but familiar story. They made world class high end tape systems, and then when CDs came along they just fell by the wayside because they didn’t innovate. They went bankrupt something like 20 years ago and were bought out by a Chinese company.\nOP, why are you going to a mechanic for car audio advice. Most mechanics aren’t also audio experts. You need to talk to a car audio installer. The Crutchfield suggestion is a good one, though you might not be able to order from them depending on what country you live in.', 'Unless you are just sitting in a parking space with the engine off, the automobile is a lousy audio environment.  Even sitting in a parking space with the engine off, it is still not a very good audio environment.  It is full of hard surfaces that reflect too much sound muddying it up.  When moving, road noises and wind noise intrude making the low volume sections hard to hear and drowning out the higher frequencies.\nIt is also a temporary environment.  People tend to not keep their vehicles all that long, and you are starting with a vehicle that is already 13-14 years old.  Yet despite all this, some people will invest more in a sound system for their car than they will for their living room.\nBut, to answer your question, a low buck head unit will have some serious limitations to getting the most of the system.  One thing for example, you might compare two units that claim to have equal power out, the high end unit will claim (and probably actually have) a lower THD (total harmonic distortion). Many will be at 0.1% or lower while the cheaper unit will have 10% at max power, if they even list the THD at all.  Most cheap units won’t because it is not good.\nTHD is very important as it caused by clipping the signal.  Think of a spring.  Let’s say the initial stiffness of the spring is 1kG per cm of stretch or compression.  For the first 5 cm, it is pretty consistent.  5cm of compression or stretch requires 5kG, 3cm requires 3kG etc.  But as you go beyond 5cm, it requires more than 1kG for every cm, say 6.5kG to go to 6cm, 8.5kG to reach 7, 11kG to reach 8cm and 20kG to reach 9cm.  You. are approaching the limits of the spring.  To go from 5 to 9 cm require an additional 15kG.\nAn amplifier has limits too.  For example a 0.01v to 0.1v input may produce a 1 to 10 watt output that is linear.  But above a 0.1v input, less power out is produced so the output curve will start to flatten out.  When that happens, the amplifier starts to produce harmonics that did not exist in the original signal, thus distorting the input.\nThis is only one way the more expensive amplifier is worth the extra cost.  There are quite a few other parameters to be considered as well but this post would get way too long.  But the cost/quality curve is also non linear.  You might get a head unit that is 5x better than the cheapest one for only 2 to 3x the cost, but after that, the next 10% increase in quality could cost you 10x as much.\nI would also not waste money on a sub unless you listen to music that has low frequency tones.  Most music does not.  Music will a strong beat does not necessarily have a lower tone.  The beat is not the tone.  But if you do get a sub, it does not need to have a larger amp than the amps to the regular speakers,  if it is more powerful, it can also distort the sound.', 'Needs are air,water, food, shelter, everything else is wants.', 'I’m really confused (or I think you are).

Where ever this unknown country is .', 'When you say “CD”. It sounds like you mean “Head Unit”   The head unit is the part of the system you interact with, it can have a radio/CD player/USB port/AUX input etc, on it.  Most modern head units don’t have CD players anymore, as most people use bluetooth or flash drives to play music.  I haven’t used a CD in about a decade.\nWhen it comes to quality, you get what you pay for. The last vehicle I had that I did an extensive aftermarket system was my old Bronco.  This would’ve been back in the late 90’s/early 2000’s.  It replaced the factory head unit (AM/FM/tape player) with a Sony headunit that was AM/FM/CD.  I replaced the crap factory speakers with Infinite Kappas ( 6.5 inch 3 way in the front doors,  6x9 2 way in the back),  added a 4 channel 400W (I think) JL audio amp to feed the Kappas, which were very power-hungry speakers.  And added a subwoofer box in the cargo area with two JL Audio 10’s powered by a JL audio 2 channel amp which was on the order of 600 watts.\nThe results were impressive to 20 year old me.  However as I got older and more boring, having a banging sound system became less of a priority.  Though these days I’m tempted to do some more quality of life improvements to my Mustang. There’s certainly room for improvement, but I really like Sync 3 and would probably just replace the factory speakers and maybe do an inline amp, and possible a stealth box sub in the trunk.\nAnyway,  a new modern head unit will probably get you some of the functionality you’re looking for (Bluetooth, USB, etc.) However a cheap head unit will not likely produce hugely better sound quality as cheap head units don’t always have noticeably more power (watts ) than a factory radio.   Peak wattage isn’t nearly as important as continuous (RMS) wattage.  Also different speakers respond better to differing amounts of power. The factory speakers almost certainly are made with lower power in mind, and they are likely of dubious quality.  Aftermarket speakers are almost always better in terms of quality, but some of the higher end ones only sound their best when they are being fed more power than a typical head unit can provide (this is where amplifiers come in). Of course there are also aftermarket speakers that are made to be powered by the head unit only as well.\nSubwoofers, particularly ones that are mounted in the trunk/boot require some planning.  How many do you want/need?  What size?, How much power is it going to take?  Can you use the head unit to bypass certain frequencies?  Can the trunk/boot be effectively matted to keep unwanted/unsoundly vibrations in check?', 'This is what I’d do.\n#1 get a new head unit with a CD player (if you want). Features like Bluetooth and added microphone can make for a nicer driving experience because now you can do hands free driving. Also adding Apply CarPlay or Andriod Auto is a nice feature, especially for using GPS. A new head unit can improve the overall sound quality.\n#2 If you think the system is lacking base then think about a woofer.

The problem is that, since it has been so long since I have even tried to drive, I would need (and want!) to take a driving refresher course.  Assuming that I pass the course and get a driver’s license again, since my left eye is basically shut down, what modifications, if any, would I need to drive as safely as possible?
I already know that I wouldn’t be driving all that much–primarily to and from the store (particularly in bad weather!), to church on the weekends, and one or two long-distance trips (circa 200 to 500 miles) each year.
As you might expect, I’m on a fixed income, so I’m certainly not in the market for anything like a Trans Am Firehawk!  Rather, I’d like a cube-shaped model with an automatic transmission.  (Remember the Nash Metropolitan?    Something like that would be my ideal, but of course they’ve been out of production for over 50 years!)

The Avalon has 108k miles, is a NY native car so has some small patches of rust underneath but nothing crazy. The dealer just replaced front and back brakes, both mufflers, the battery, and a metal strip that runs under the gas tank. It’s had one owner and no accidents. Test drive felt good.
The corolla is from PA, and has just about no rust underneath because of that. It has 134k miles. Back brakes need to be done but the dealer said he would do that up and anything else needed.

Always negotiate based on what an industry-standard pricing guide such as Kelley Blue Book or NADA Guide says the vehicle is worth.  And of course, your negotiations should include reasonable deductions for required but unsubstantiated maintenance, such as a timing belt replacement interval which was reached, but the seller has no proof the work was ever done.  The value, of course, depends on whether you are buying from a private party or a licensed dealer, and the vehicle’s condition, mileage, equipment/features, and engine/transmission type.\n“Excellent” condition means a vehicle with a clear title, no body damage, and all required maintenance has been done.  By definition, a vehicle with a restored salvage title, unrepaired body damage, excessive wear to the interior, or overdue for major maintenance is not in “excellent” condition, and should be priced accordingly.\nSo for example, if you are looking at a 2008 XYZ Car from a private seller, you’d examine the car, make sure there is no body damage, fluid leaks, funny noises, etc, make sure the seller has a valid title in their name, and jot down the mileage and other details.  Then, before any discussion of price, you’d go to KBB or NADA online, plug in the details, and see what a fair private party value would be.  When buying from a dealer, the process is similar, except that a dealer must by law convey clear title, so you don’t have to ask about this, and you’d be looking for the fair dealer retail price range.', '\n\n\n BDazzle:\n\nI was thinking 20-30%,\n\n\nThat much of a discount will only be on something that the used dealer really wants off the lot because they know it is a marginal vehicle.\nI guess you decided against the Cadillac .

And yet, those folks would probably say that their car was “well-maintained”.\nIf the previous owner(s) changed the oil on the basis of odometer mileage, rather than elapsed time, it is entirely possible that they only changed the oil every 3 years, and that would give you a disaster waiting to happen.

But the earlier posts are spot-on.\nCheck tires, change ALL the fluids, check rubber brake lines and replace the tires because they are likely original.', 'Guy by me has had a Miata in his driveway under a big tree for 10yrs.

That was a messy job that I did in the garage over a week or two, because I could get by without the car.  So yes, absolutely, buy the car.  You get a near new car that reliably starts and it’s genuinely fun to drive any time.  Drop the top (about a minute’s chore) and you’re on the way.  If it costs you $800 for tires and another $500 for a mechanic to look it over and renew what’s getting old, remember you’re getting a near new car for $10,000.']",9,481

However - from day one the headlights have flickered when braking or accelerating. Next, typically if I don’t drive the car for 5-7 days, the car won’t start and I have to use one of those “jump starter” batteries to get it going. I know that’s not normal. A couple days ago it wouldn’t start after only 3 days of sitting around. At one point out doing errands it wouldn’t even start after I drove it a mile from one place to another, even though it’d been driven for 20 minutes before that shorter trip. It has been this bad before. Last time I bought a new battery - that was only two years ago. This can’t be a series of bad batteries, what are the odds of that…
So I figure there’s some kind of voltage leak; I tried a little to find it on my own, but I know that’s a problem that’s almost impossible to diagnose and could cost $1000 or something if I try to get it fixed.
Of course this problem is really annoying, but also my gut tells me that given this history, I shouldn’t be surprised if the car develops a lot of problems starting at some point soon, especially electrical ones. The BB value is currently somewhere between $4000-$5500.
So am I right to think I should bail now, before it suddenly develops a problem that really has to be dealt with instead of a problem that’s just really annoying? I don’t like the idea of sinking hundreds or thousands into it, or having the BB value drop by a lot soon.","['I’d get rid of it now. It’s a shame the problem wasn’t found in warranty.

Now since you explained how you came to this part name I can assure you that what you are looking at are not pieces of an expansion valve(I thought you actualy knew what an expansion valve was).

Oldschool has his good points.  But sometimes you just have to let him say whatever it is he says and kind of let it go.  (Or argue ad infinitum about nothing).\nAnyway, it seems clear that a bit of your A/C system blew for some reason.  You can safely drive the car though you won’t have A/C.  You do want to take it back to the shop that serviced it asap since your A/C system is now open to the atmosphere.

When an A/C system lets go there is a huge steam cloud that will disappear quickly but the noise and possibly the interior of the car filling with a dense white fog could have caused you to lose control of the car and who knows what then.\n(The steam cloud is caused by the fact that R134 refrigerant boils at something like 20 below zero so you can see what will happen when it’s exposed to 70 degree temps outside.)']",2,10.5k

Guess I’m not clear on if you are talking about the old rear engine Beetle or the new front engine models when you say you like the retro stuff. The PT was such a big hit when it came out that GM hired the designer to build the HHR which was actually a better vehicle in most regards. I remember that we ran out of PTs many times due to how popular they were at the time. I must ay that the PT Dream Cruiser was pretty cool too! They were usually sold before they got to the dealérship. Regardless of either choice it comes down to what you prefer and can afford to get fixed and keep up, maintenance wise. Both the PT and new Beetle, made for US sales, were assembled in Mexico. Not that it matters but just a point of information. PT parts and service are MUCH less expensive for sure. VW parts and service are much more. Many mechanics and shops have told us they won’t work on them due to being such a pain to work on and diagnos and tell us to go to a dealership. My girlfriend has an 08 EOS that’s a pain in the butt, as many are from others we’ve talked to. She has taken it to the shop countless times due to a check engine light that no one seems to be able to diagnos. They send it out with the light off then before she gets home it pops back on again so no inspection sticker again over and over and over. It has a 2.0 turbo that is VERY quick and the retractable hard top is cool! It looks like Transformer when it operates. I believe the new Beetle was offered with the same engine as a choice as well but I’m not totally sure. Her’s is an 08 and the interior panels are seperating, the glue doesn’t hold the faux leather to the panels anymore and there are countless other issues both cosmetic and mechanical. She’s had bad luck with it and we’ve heard so many horror stories from others about similar newer VWs, that we won’t be getting one in the future that I can see. I remember at the Dodge dealership our used car sales manager would extremely “lowball” the trade #'s on the new beetle that customers brought in because he said they just weren’t worth it. These are just my experiences with VW in the past decade so you can see my obvious prejudice against them. Maybe someone else on here can give you better info than I can but they aren’t for me. Now, the older VWs? Heck yeah! Reliability, nostalga and easy to work on. I’ll buy a good used Rabbit (very rare to find), Beetle, Karman Ghia or bus any day! The original Beetles… 4 bolts, some wires to disconnect, fuel line and 2 people could lift the engine to a stand or table to work on if needed. I’ve had 3 VWs in the past. My dad had 2.

It’s best I defer that to someone else with more technical knowledge though. In that case I would try to find one that you can verify when it was last done which may be difficult to find out.

So I currently own a 2015 Chevrolet Volt with all the bells and whistles.  It’s a fantastic car that I’ve owned for 2.5 years and counting.
I drive about 1200-1500 miles a month (occasionally for work) in Los Angeles.  It’s the perfect ‘commuter’ car: comfy, economical, doesn’t feel like a Prius.  My reasons for getting rid of it is:

Value on them seem decent, and I’m hoping I can get around 12-14k (leaving me about 4-6k as a downpayment for another vehicle—My sweet spot for a car payment is about $300-350/mo
Long term–I feel like I’m chained to the dealer if anything ever goes wrong with this thing
Anxiety driving further, road trips etc… Car doesn’t have a spare; I’ve experienced a flat tire on this thing 4x in ownership and don’t wanna drive it pass 100 miles (like to Vegas)
Bored? My personal record was 2,000 consecutive miles on pure electricity–5,000 on one tank of gas.  Geez does that sound incredibly lame…but I loved tracking this stuff

I’m just having a hard time shutting my brain off and looking at other cars.  I’ve always wanted a relatively reliable, practical daily car that’s not gonna cost an arm and leg like a BMW (however, if I do through Carmax I’d get that sweet warranty to offset it)
My ideal car would get 30+ MPGs on HWY, HP/TQ enough to have some fun with (I had a manual Acura ILX–same specs as a Civic Si; want something with a little more umph), relatively reliable (don’t wanna get stranded regualrly, if ever), practical DD to haul 4 people on a road trip decently with luggage–(our other car is an ND Miata (my girlfriend’s)
Options:
Gen 2 Chevrolet Volt–WHY?! YOU’RE GOING BACK TO THE SAME THING
Well—it uses regular gas, has adaptive cruise control, Apple CarPlay, goes about 25% further on electricity and my nerdy self wants to see how far I can push that, regular gas, it’s more fuel efficient too, I reallllly like it in blue.
VW GTI-- fits all the needs, just uncertain if I want to hop back in a manual (I really don’t mind) IDK about reliability
VW Golf R–Can I/should I afford it? How much better is it than the GTI?
Subaru WRX–Too boy toy-ish? (I used to have an Evo X)
Subaru BRZ/86—we have the Miata, but I’ve always liked these
BMW 1/2 series–1 series may be too old as far as tech for me; 2 series just worried about long term reliability + depreciation
Mini Cooper Clubman–I rented a Countryman, it wasn’t half bad. Liked the quirkiness, just uneasy with reliability

I would think a long time before buying an electric car, even though I like the idea. I need a minivan and thought about the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid.  I decided to buy another Toyota Sienna with its old technology.  I decided I could buy a lot of gasoline for the difference in price.\nI bought a used Black and Decker battery powered mower about four years ago.  After the first season, I had to replace the batteries.  I spent $65 for the pair of new batteries.  These batteries lasted two seasons.  I spent another $65 for a pair of batteries.  I mowed for 10 minutes and the mower quit.  The controller board had failed.  I found that the controller board is no longer available.  I thought about bypassing the controller with an on/off switch between the battery and the motor.  However, there would have been no overload protection, nor no safety control.  I finally donated the mower to Goodwill industries.  I decided I could buy a lot of gasoline for the $65 I would spend every two years for batteries.  These were sealed lead acid batteries.  I assume the lithium ion batteries on the new mowers are better.', '@Triedaq I agree on purely economic grounds. The good electric cars are jaw-droppingly expensive, and the cheap electric cars are. . .Well.  Cheap.  And even on the good ones, the more shenanigans Musk pulls, the less sad I am that I couldn’t quite swing a Tesla on my last car purchase. The last one where he remotely disabled options that customers were told they were getting because “well the first owner paid for them, but the second owner did not” was the final straw for me as far as supporting Tesla as a company. Hopefully Lucid builds a good competitor and doesn’t pull the shady moves Tesla is becoming known for.\nThe new Leaf is showing a lot more promise as they finally got into the triple digits for range, and the price isn’t too far out of line from what you’d pay for a normal gas car.  But $40,000 will still buy a lot of car and pull you out of the compact hatchback market, so it’s still in some ways a sacrifice. And unlike with the Teslas, if you buy a $40,000 Leaf you don’t get supercar levels of acceleration to play with.\nNow, if your thinking leads you to places other than pure economics and also to the ecological then electric cars make more sense, because the sooner they become more popular, the sooner their prices come down so that other people can buy them. And unlike a gas car, electric cars can run on clean, renewable power sources. And even if they aren’t currently plugged into such sources, when the power company builds a new wind/solar farm, the car gets cleaner. That’s something that can’t be said for gas burners. And as an aside, I assume OP is not thinking ecologically, because replacing your car every 2-3 years is not ecologically sound.\nOn the mower, interestingly (well, probably not interesting to anyone but me) I just traded a perfectly good Honda mower for a Stihl battery-powered one. We’ve removed so much grass in favor of landscaping and native plant beds that dealing with gas just didn’t make sense anymore. I can now mow the lawn in 30 minutes flat.  I’m enjoying the new mower for the most part. It’s a lot more quiet than any gas mower, and cuts well. There are a few annoyances, the biggest one involving the drive motor staying engaged after you release the bar. It doesn’t move the mower, but you can’t pull the mower backwards until you push it slightly forward. Irritating, but that’s not unusual on 2nd gen battery mowers, and it removes the annoyances of stabilizing fuel, changing oil, etc.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nOn the mower, interestingly (well, probably not interesting to anyone but me)\n\n\nThere are a lot of us that really do like the latest models of battery powered mowers .', '@shadowfax.

I’ve decided to buy a used car off craigslist.  I just need it for 6 months so my plan is to sell it at the end of the 6 month period of ownership. I don’t care how it looks or what make and model.  I just want decent gas mileage (at least 25mpg or so).  I’m basically looking to get the lowest cost of ownership over 6 months.
So based on hours of internet research and asking questions of car experts, my search criteria are:
-Price between $400 and $3k (anything below $400 and you get a bunch of $0 listings and $100 financing offers, and anything too much over $3k I get too many results and start to lose money on depreciation from what I understand)
-Any non-Euro make (I’m told in this price range it’s how they’ve been maintained not what make they are.  So Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Dodge, Chevy, Chrysler, Ford, GMC, Buick, Kia, Hyundai, Subaru, Scion, Mitsubishi, Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, Cadillac, Pontiac, Saturn are OK but NO to Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Volvo, Saab, Volkswagen, Jaguar, Fiat, Mini
-Under 200k miles
-Cars listed by owner, not a dealer.
-Minimum model year should be 2000 or later, for crash safety
-Title should be clean or rebuilt but not salvage (I’m told accidents don’t matter so much at this price level and major issues will be detected during my mechanic’s inspection; Just not looking at anything that has damage that must be fixed since it’s rarely worth it.)
Based on the above search, I’ve come up with the following candidates:
1)) https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/cto/d/seattle-chevy-malibu-maxx-ls-2005/7168348314.html 1 I was all set to go test drive it but I just noticed the listing says “Air Con not blowing cold at present.” I asked the owner if he knows why and he said “No I did not get that checked out yet.” I definitely need cold AC so is this a dealbreaker as I’m guessing it might be very expensive to fix a broken AC?

Are these too light on info and pics to bother inquiring about?

He said he really didn’t want to go below $2000, and I asked the mechanic on the side if $1900 was a fair price and he said it was in the ballpark so I just agreed to $2000 since the seller was a super nice guy and had already come down in price so much.

With two owners, and 88,000 miles, this is probably not a CPO, so there would be no factory-backed warranty.  The dealer may, of course, be offering a so-called “extended warranty” from a third-party insurance company, but those are often not worth the paper they’re printed on.\nThat being said, the Kia uses a metal timing chain, which means less costly maintenance, and has much less miles on it.  Also, Honda has had issues with its automatic transmissions, especially if the fluid is not changed.  The Kia has low enough miles that you could have the transmission fluid changed after you buy it, and not need to worry that its life has been shortened by insufficient maintenance.\nSince Korean-branded vehicles also depreciate faster than Japanese-branded models, we can assume that it also costs less than the Honda.

It all depends on your appetite for risk vs. cost to maintain.', 'Having been through it, for cars through the 1970’s the general wisdom was “Unload at 50,000 miles” but because of today’s vastly improved materials and assembly 100,000 miles simply expected and often exceeded. Much depends on how it was driven and maintained but remember that most cars at that mileage are pushing 10 years old and nothing lasts forever. Parts wear out, plastics degrade, rubber cracks and steel rusts.\nFor myself I have several cars over 150,000 miles and over 15 years old and running like a top BUT I bought them new, obsessively maintained them and can do most of the repair work myself which keeps the repair costs in line AND I have a much newer car that that I can use when I need complete reliability or when one of the other cars is being repaired.\nSo you need to do a personal inventory, of your own needs, abilities and finances.', '\n\n\n SteveCBT:\n\nYes it is worth it but depends on the price and condition. Take the car that you like the most to an independent mechanic and for around $100 or so have them check it out. If taken care of the 100K mark is not a deal breaker.\n\n\n+1\nBut, the absolutely most important factor is how well the car has been maintained.\nMy vehicle has been maintained better than is required by the mfr’s maintenance schedule, and as a result it remains problem-free at 105k miles.  Even though I will probably treat myself to a new vehicle within the next year or two, I believe that my current vehicle would be likely to remain reliable–with little need for repairs–for many more years/miles.', '\n\n\n john.smith0909123_160324:\n\nSo if you have to put in new break pads\n\n\nbreak pads ?

The first year on a new car is almost always the most expensive year in the car’s life.\nThat being said, the age of a car you should buy vs the age of a car you should keep are two different calculations.  A used car may well have an invisible problem that someone is trying to get rid of.  In contrast, I know intimately the condition of my 250k mi daily driver, and I would not part with it.\nThe right car for you and the right car for your wife or daughter are two different calculations.  A newer car is slightly (but only slightly) less likely to suffer an unexpected failure that leaves it stranded on the road at night.  Cell phones have reduced that concern, but still, I try to keep my wife in a car with less than 100k miles on it.  When her car hit 125k miles, I got her a ‘new’ off-lease car with 22k miles.

A four year old car that you paid 50% for though will be worth another 50% after 4 years or 25% of new.  Take your pick.  It’s just math.

The car is over 2.5 hrs- 4.5 away depending on traffic and construction. I have ME and the exertion from the trip will likely cause me to feel more sick for about 3 weeks following the trip.

My other concern is on the CarFax (link to it on the dealer page, or directly at https://www.carfax.com/VehicleHistory/ar20/RmnpEIUUsEtEhugd7Wuu_3fTYUSUxlSOm7qnijgGiFBpwZ0gIVskChlP4JfXnV49NYW-TFxuiRbSR3TmK6jdHagobfjdZAjdCX8?cs:o=‘carfax’ 8. The second owner, toward their end of ownership, visited the dealer or other repair shop 6 times in two months, then traded the car in. This strikes me as suspicious… why would you spend that money if you know you’re just getting rid of the car soon? Maybe a lot of issues needing to be fixed and it finally got to the point of “get rid of it?” Maybe I’m just being paranoid?
If someone in the know could spend a few minutes are give me their advice on this car and it’s history it’d be much appreciated. I plan on test driving it tomorrow and if I choose to make an offer it will be on having a mechanic check it out first. But I would like a second opinion from someone here if things seem like they are suspicious (dropped $1000 off the price, lots of repairs immediately before trade in, on the lot for 8 months) or on the up and up and its a good deal.
Another car we’re considering is http://www.sharonchevrolet.com/VehicleDetails/used-2014-Honda-CR_V-LX_AWD-Liverpool-NY/4599603753 4. They are willing to take $15,500.

It looks like the owner may have waited until it was time for an emissions inspection to get the first oil change done. Not good.\nThis would likely lead to engine trouble down the road, no pun intended.  Just based on that alone, and the increased service visits, would be enough for me to look at another vehicle.\nAs far as the second vehicle in your post, I have no idea.', 'You do know that CarFax is not exactly accurate, right?

The lessee had the oil changed annually since they didn’t drive more than 5000 miles on average each year. The second changed oil a little over 7000 miles, and that matches my experience with Hondas. The transmission fluid was changed twice. This CRV seems like a pretty good bet. You should still take it to your mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection.

85,Certified with higher miles vs. not certified with lower miles,Buying/Selling,[],galant,"['VOLVO-V70', 'VDCdriver', 'Barkydog', 'switters', 'ok4450', 'Mustangman', 'jtsanders']","We’re about to buy a used car. We don’t drive much, maybe 6-8k miles a year. We’re looking at two options right now:

A certified pre-owned vehicle sold by a local dealership. They’ve extended the warranty until 3/2023 or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. It is a 2017 and has 48k miles on it.
A non-certified pre-owned vehicle sold by a dealership over 1,000 miles away. They would ship the car to me. It’s a 2017, but only has 21k miles and is cheaper. The dealership gets 5 stars on Google and other rating sites.

With option #1, we have a warranty for almost 3 years, we can test drive the vehicle, and if something goes wrong we can take the car into the dealer that we bought it from to request that they make it right. On the other hand, 48k miles seems like a lot for 3 years, and it costs more than the vehicle that is the same model year but with less than half of the miles on it.
Option #2 is a low miles vehicle sold by a reputable dealership with great reviews. But it doesn’t come with any warranty or even any guarantee that a detailed inspection was done, and I’m concerned about what recourse we’d have (probably none) if something went wrong.
What do you think?","['\n\n\n switters:\n\nA non-certified pre-owned vehicle sold by a dealership over 1,000 miles away. They would ship the car to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n switters:\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nI think one would have to be very foolish to buy a car under those circumstances.', 'Great questions!\nOption 1,   “Certified Used” is marketing hype. It means nothing.  The extra cost of the car is the cost of the extended warranty. That’s it. Many of the extended warranty companies are complete rip-off. The only extended warranty I’d consider is one from the manufacturer of the car… and I don’t buy extended warranties.\nOption 2,  No warranty so the cost is lower. That dealer has checked out the car because they don’t want to sully their reputation on poor cars. That said… find an independent mechanic near the dealer and PAY them to do an inspection on the car. Should cost you $125 or so. Best money you will ever spend.\nIf they give the OK, the cheaper, lower mile car is the one I’d pick and I would not buy an extended warranty, or paint sealant, or pinstripes, or whatever else the dealer wants to tack on.\nIf the dealer will give you a right of refusal on the car shipped to your home, or better yet, a 3-7 day return policy - in writing - I’d schedule your local mechanic to give it the once over after delivery.', 'I’m in agreement with both VDCdriver and Mustangman for the most part.\nOption 2 is not even an option IMO. Any recourse over a problem would have to be taken care of in the state where that dealer is located. You really want multiple 2000 miles road trips or having to spend long distance lawyer money? What if that car arrives on a transport and the engine has a rod knock or that the reason the miles are so low is because the car has been sitting behind a body shop for ages during a legal squabble after being plowed into by a Kenworth or Ford Excursion? Six of one…  \nI always take internet reviews or complaints with a grain of salt.\nOf the two, Option 1 would be my choice although I agree that CPO may not mean much.  An inspection is only as good as the person doing that inspection and whether or not that mechanic/inspector at the dealership has just gotten screwed over on another job. If the mechanic has gotten ripped just recently the odds are much higher that he may just pencil whip that inspection and run it out the door.\nYears ago I worked for a dealer that sold CPO cars and not one of those cars ever entered the shop for an inspection. They did enter the detail shop for cleaning so it’s assumed the “inspections” were done by the wash room guys who knew little to nothing about mechanical things.\nReason why? Wash room guy inspection is much, much cheaper than the service department…\nAnd keep in mind that even with Option 1 warranty does NOT pay for every problem that crops up. If One is solid then it should last you forever at the rate you accrue miles.', 'Thanks! Appreciate your reply.\nTo clarify, the local dealer that is offering the warranty is the manufacturer of the car. As far as I know, it’s not a third-party extended warranty. In the description of the car, it says “The factory warranty has been extended until 03/30/2023 or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.” Would your comments still apply?', '\n\n\n switters:\n\nWould your comments still apply?\n\n\nYes, I’d still avoid the car because IF the manufacturer has extended the warranty to 100K miles, I’d have to wonder why did they do that? You’d need to research the complaints about this particular model here:  Carcomplaints.com 1\nPlus it is still more expensive than the other car. I don’t know HOW much more expensive but combine that with the extra 27K miles, and I’d still go for Option 2.', 'What are these vehicles ? I personally would not buy a vehicle sight unseen used with out a test drive .\nI also don’t think much of the CPO designation .', 'Why would you consider a car that is 1000 miles away?  Is it so unique that there isn’t a suitable similar one much closer?  I would not consider option 2 unless I went to the dealership, drove the car, then had it checked by a local, independent garage, despite the low mileage.\nFor option 1, see if you can find out how long it has been for sale. This information should be available on a CarFax that the dealer has often already paid for. You just download it from their web site. If it has been on the lot for longer than 3 months, make a offer much closer to the average dealer sales price without the CPO designation. You should still have it checked out by an independent garage, even though it is a CPO. Motorweek did a segment on CPO cars, and that was their recommendation.', 'As you can see from a number of replies… many are not comfortable buying a car while not standing beside it.  A lot of these posters have significant knowledge about cars and could very well do their own inspections. Many could test drive the cars and tell right away that there is something amiss with the car. I think that affects their decisions about whether this is a reasonable way to purchase a car.\nI personally would not sign on the dotted line until I had driven the exact car I was going to buy AND inspected the underside it while on a hoist.\nThat said, if the buyer is not a knowledgeable car person, and could not recognize these things themselves, what does it matter that the car is inspected by a mechanic 1000 miles away or in their own neighborhood?  Also if there is a “right of refusal” or a return period, how would distance affect the deal? We are seeing sellers like Carvana doing exactly this. CarMax does this to a degree but the final test drive, inspection and buying process is the same as always.\nDiscuss…  ', 'That’s definitely me. I’m not a knowledgable car person and may not recognize issues. The car that is not local still has 7 months on the original manufacturer’s warranty, so at least I’d have some protection. The dealer that is selling it actually requires a local mechanic to inspect it if the buyer isn’t going to travel there to test drive it.', 'The car 1000 miles away might be just fine or better. But, I would never buy a car sight unseen, not even a brand new one. I like to check it out, inside, outside, underneath, under the hood, then take it for a spin. I have had a dealer want to sell a brand new car to me with the rear quarter panel being painted. They said “we didn’t do it, they sometimes get damaged during the shipping and get painted, you still have the warranty”, and I was like yeah. I will think about it.\nIf I am buying a newer car, I prefer the CPO by manufacturer. If you think the mileage is high for your liking, look around, like within 100 miles so you can drive and check the car out. One with lower mileage might be $500 to $1000 more.', 'Again I ask , what are these vehicles just because I am nosy !', 'Sorry, missed that last time. The local one is a Range Rover. The one that is out of the area is a Range Rover Sport. (This explains why the local one is more expensive, despite having more miles.

Once the warranty was due to expire, he dumped it and resolved to never buy another Rover.', 'Apparently a lot of people don’t share your distaste for Range Rovers.

So was I, but there it is.', 'I personally would go for the warranty, what is the cost difference?', 'I agree with @Barkydog since this is a Range Rover.\n@switters, the extended warranty is a factory warranty, correct?

This, of course, specifically excludes any third-party “extended warranty” or “service plan” or similar pseudo-insurance backed by any entity other than the manufacturer itself.  Anything this recent, and with such low miles is going to be expensive, and will necessitate a monthly loan payment for most people.\nor\nBuy an inexpensive older car, which obviously won’t have a warranty, but it also won’t have a monthly loan payment either.\n\nPersonally, I prefer strategy #2.  I live in southern Arizona, so cars don’t rust.  Therefore, a 15-20 year old car for $1500-2500 is a good buy, and even with maintenance and repairs is a bargain compared to a monthly payment and full-coverage insurance on a financed vehicle.\nHowever, buying this 8 year old Hyundai with 78,000 miles doesn’t conform to either of these strategies.  It’s too old to have any manufacturer’s warranty (remember that the 10-year 100,000 powertrain warranty is available only to the original owner) and it’s way to expensive to be considered a disposable car if major repairs are needed.  If you’re comfortable spending $6k, then I’d spend 2-3k more and get a newer car with much less miles.

At the very least, borrow a carpet shampooer and clean up the stains.\nLook at it this way, even if it were otherwise worth $1900, you can deduct a couple hundred to replace the windshield, $1,000 to fix the air conditioner, and who knows how much to fix the check engine light that absolutely must be fixed before the next owner can register the car.

I feel it’s basically a good car and family members who live in ME own several 4cyl. Subaru’s of that general vintage with 160kmi to over 250kmi with no serious issues (though a friend’s 2006 H4 OB needed head gaskets at ~ 90Kmi).  At the  mileage you’re considering much will depend upon the use and care it’s received.\nThings we like:  engine power - gobbs of it, at 95mph up hill in hot desert pushing a roof top box there’s still passing reserve.  Transmission, and AWD in Sierra winters (with the right tires) work well.  Love the ground clearance.  Brakes are great.  Handling is good (Pirelli All Season tires were fine on snow and ice and the present Michelins are even better, the Maine contingent likes Continentals).  A/C is strong, even at 108degrees in desert.  It’s comfortable on trips and pretty quiet, the sun roof is nice (be sure all 4 drains flow freely, the rear drains are hidden behind the wrap around bumper).  Despite what some say spark plugs are relatively easy to change, following on-line instructions.  Same for full ATF flushes, lines are easy to reach.  The engine seems to do as well on Subaru’s conventional oil as it does on Subaru’s and several other brands of synthetics.  Suggest changing <=5,000mi. (judging from continuous, summer interstate driving, any type oil) or 6mo., whichever is sooner - the owner’s. manual seems too long even for synthetics.\nNot as great:  Gas mileage - ~ 24-25mpg (premium) on interstates once the oil is warmed up and with very smooth transitions isn’t too bad, but going ~ 20-25mi. per trip on freeway gives ~ 20mpg, and mileage drops to  15-16mpg around town when driving 5-8mi. at a time.    The front struts were bad at 47kmi and bushings had collapsed  (they were 11yrs old) - there are better after-market struts.  A front CV boot split at ~ 60kmi  (the joint was good, so repaired with a $25 NAPA boot kit).\nCatalytic converter heat shields are rattle prone - very expensive at the dealer but there are home brew ways to clamp them.\nSubaru AWD especially doesn’t like mismatched tires (wears out the mechanism), check that all tires are the same model, size, and very close to the same wear.  Tires should be within about 0.25inches (6mm) of each other in circumference (I measure with a flat tape), and rotated at the specified interval.\nThere are some complaints on the forums about valve cover gasket oil leaks and ours may be starting, but much less expensive than head gasket repair.  Inspect for both head and valve cover leaks.\nThe auto cabin temp controls are a pain, set 1 degree higher or lower than the present temperature  and they blast full hot or cold until the new set point is reached.   We live with it.\nThe cabin air filter requires perhaps 40 minutes and many screws to change, but easier the second time.   Ours is loaded up by 20,000mi.\nHead light bulb changing (halogens) is a moderate pain, but doable.

Tire Rack, Discount Tire, and others list the circumference limits as 0.25in for Subarus as opposed to 0.5in. for most other makes - a potential explanation is that the Subaru system is engaged full time and thus always “slipping” whereas others wait for detection of slippage at the wheels before engaging (but this is beyond my direct knowledge).  I know of one person, who races cars and has a complete shop, whose personal ride is an older Outback with manual transmission (I believe the MT versions have a different coupler design than the AT’s) that had mismatched tire brands when he purchased it used.

They said it needs tires, rear sway bar to frame and both front strut mounts and alignment are out. I am afraid they may have over-exaggerated because later the same day my mechanic changed the my front tires and now the pulling and vibration are gone. is this something I should let the buyer know of and give a huge discount for it or the Camry can last for a few more years with this and we don’t need to stress out too much? thank you!","['Let’s not kid ourselves here.  You are selling an 18-year old car with over 200,000 miles on it.  It is not perfect, nor does any reasonable person considering buying this type of car expect it to be.  If you installed new tires and now the car drives fine,  it stands to reason that the ride quality issues were due to a defective tire, and have now been resolved.\nIt sounds like the mechanic’s diagnosis was incorrect or alternatively the parts he mentioned may indeed be worn past their service limit, however the problem which precipitated bringing the car for repair has been resolved, namely one or more defective tires.  In any case, you are under no obligation to disclose anything other than actual problems which you know about.  You have no idea if the suspension components will need replacing in the not-too-distant future, and it’s really not your job to worry about that.  The likelihood that the car will need repairs and maintenance due to age and wear is already accounted for in the Blue Book price once you enter the mileage.\nSimply go to KBB and look for “private party selling price” or “my car’s value”.  Then enter the details of this car (engine type, transmission type, features and options, paint color, odometer mileage), and then choose a condition based on how the body and interior look.  That will give both a target value, and a range of what you can reasonably expect to sell the car for.', 'You could probably find a dozen other things wrong that could be done too so just leave it up to the buyer to determine condition.  I can’t believe that’s all that would need doing on a car that old with that many miles.  The other thing is I’m having trouble seeing how the strut mounts would be bad but not making any noise?  You aren’t an expert and not expected to be so just leave it alone.  You’re selling an old car.', 'What did your mechanic say about the suspension issues?  If your mechanic didn’t find problems, it is unlikely that  the work needs to be done right now. Also, is a safety inspection required for the new owner to register this car?

You also don’t want to get too fast of a car because you’re 17, you most likely suck at driving like 99% of all other 17 year olds (which is fine, if driving didn’t require skill development everyone could be a Formula 1 driver), and it’s a lot easier to recover from mistakes in a 150hp car than in a 500hp car.\nI would avoid getting a truck. If you get a truck then everyone in your class will want you to help them move after graduation. Owning a pickup means the whole neighborhood thinks they now have a timeshare in a pickup.  You’ll also spend more in insurance and most likely gas.\nIf you do go the truck route, I would avoid any serious offroading for now unless you somehow have a lot more disposable income than most high school students.

The MSRP for this car was $22,600. the person who sold it to the dealer probably got less than $11,000 for it. This allowed me to conclude that the previous owner who drove it basically not all (2,000 miles in 8 years), took 23,000 dollars and turned it into 11,000 dollars, and basically kissed 12,000 goodbye by buying a car that they didn’t even drive.
I hear all the time people like to “know the history of the vehicle” so they buy brand new cars, but they don’t even bother to do their own maintenance or do simple things like changing their own oil. How is this of any benefit? You bring your brand new car to get maintenance done at a shop. They report on the VIN that maintenance was performed. If was actually done or not, if they used high quality products, if it was done properly, who knows because the owner didn’t actually do it themselves. Don’t you have that same uncertainty in the history of the maintenance of the vehicle when you buy a used car that has reported maintenance on the VIN?
I know that if you buy a new car you know if it has been in an accident or not. But can’t you just get a used car and check to see if it has been in an accident? If you don’t trust the vehicle history, can’t you just go around and measure the paint thickness to determine if the car has been in a crash and has repainted, or check to see if the panels are aligned correctly?
I don’t see the incentive to ever buy a new car (not used) because of the financial hit you take in it. Even if you completely disregard the money you loose in buying a new car, I don’t see any incentive in getting a new car over a used one, especially if you don’t do your own maintenance. I mean if you do your own maintenance than MAYBE it would be justifiable. You could even use parts that are ever better quality than the OEM.

I’m a mom of two, a toddler and a newborn. I made the rookie mistake of purchasing a 2011 Subaru Tribeca with third row seating thinking that I could skip the lackluster minivan life. As soon as baby two came home and we went for a family ride I realized I made a mistake-it’s too small to fit anyone else in it and the third row isn’t accessible with car seats installed in the middle row, but I can’t get the baby’s seat in in the third. It’s a beautiful car but doesn’t meet our family’s needs and gets lousy gas mileage for not having the space we need. I’m selling the Tribeca and searching for a minivan.
We are a Toyota Honda Subaru fam so our options are a bit limited in terms of minivans with lower mileage AND we really really try to not finance cars so we need it to be accessible. I like simplicity-not a lot of bells and whistles, and I need a minivan that will drive my kiddos and around town and the occasional summer trip to MI from IN.
I’ve been looking at 2009-2011ish Siennas and Odysseys with anywhere from 82-130k mi under 11,500. We’d put some $ down and finance the remainder hoping for less than $100/mo payments. BUT THEN I found a private sale single owner 2000 Sienna w 104k mi asking 3,400. I pulled the Carfax and it seems it was well maintained by the dealership it was purchased from, but is not showing records for long periods of time. I wonder if this means oil changes happened at home? One hopes?
So here’s my question: we’re going to have a used car inspection on the 2000. I’m tempted to go for it if it checks out, but fear I should just focus my attention on a newer 2009-2011 model and accept a small monthly payment?
What would Car Talk fans do? Go for a 2000 sienna if it checks out, or focus on a 2009-2011 and take on a little car payment. I’m uncertain!

If any of these things are false, then $3400 isn’t just high for this vehicle–it’s “crack pipe” pricing!\nA quick glance at kbb.com shows that this vehicle with 104,000 miles, and with the roof rack and towing package has a fair market value of $1813 to $3658, with a target value of about $2800 for one in “excellent” condition.  While I might be willing to overpay by several hundred dollars for a vehicle that I want, which is in excellent condition, and has been properly maintained, I’m certainly not willing to pay “crack pipe” pricing for one that’s not.\nBottom line: If the vehicle otherwise checks out, but the seller has no proof of a timing belt replacement–which they probably don’t, hence why they’re selling it–then you need to negotiate the price down accordingly.

Sometimes they mind my thoroughness, sometimes they don’t, and I never mind them caring one way or another. If I can’t get a good check I walk away.\nFor folks not all that vehicle inspection savvy, they should probably either not buy used cars OR at least have a used vehicle inspected by a competent, trusted mechanic PRIOR to purchase, not AFTER purchase. It could result in less drama, as in this instance, and lead to a wonderful car purchase or be some money “wasted” (actually, well spent) when problems are discovered.\nI was living winters in road salt country and I think  it’s not that unusual for road salt to pretty much digest a 14 model-year-old vehicle. For sure, that must be checked before purchase.\nAnyhow, if the car runs well, looks okay, drives okay, drive it. Keep having inspections and when it comes time when the rust has had its way with it and it becomes unsafe then stop driving it. Attach the license plates to another car. Every car has this day, some sooner than others.\nHopefully it will work out okay.

Depending, of course, what the “taxes and fees” come to.\nIf the Caravan has ANY evidence of a past accident, ANY rust or body damage, or has a salvage/rebuilt/reconstructed title, I’d walk away.  Many of these vans make it to a quarter of a million miles without major issues, so I’d say there’s probably a good 30,000 to 40,000 miles left in this thing.  I would assume that if the previous owner had not changed the oil regularly, or had the transmission fluid changed at least once, this would not have reached 150,000 miles, let alone 216,000 miles.\nJust do the usual due diligence:\n\nBring an inexpensive OBDII code reader/scan tool.  Plug it in to the diagnostic port immediately before you start the engine.\n\nPrior to starting the engine, check the oil with the dipstick, and open the oil fill cap and look inside for evidence of sludge buildup.  Put the oil fill cap back on.  There is no transmission dipstick on this model, otherwise I’d suggest checking that too for fluid condition only (level can only be checked with the engine idling in park).\nStart the engine from cold, open the radiator cap, make sure there aren’t any bubbles as the engine warms up, put the radiator cap back on, make sure the temperature gauge reaches the normal position and the heater works.  Check under the vehicle to ensure there aren’t any leaks.\nAs the engine warms up, examine the body for fit and finish, again check for fluid leaks, check your code reader/scan tool to make sure there are no current, pending, or permanent codes set, and that no more than one monitor says “not ready”.  (This is the most that is permitted on a 2001 or newer vehicle, to still be able to pass emissions/inspection.)\nTake a long test-drive, lasting for at least 20 minutes and at least 15 miles, driven both in city traffic (so you can see if the engine overheats or misfires at low speed, or if the transmission has difficulty upshifting on demand) and on a freeway or other road with a 50 MPH or higher speed limit (so you can see if the engine overheats or misfires at high speed, or the transmission slips or whines in higher gears).  Begin the test-drive by backing out of a parking space, so you can see that reverse works.\n\nAt the conclusion of the test-drive, but before turning the engine off, again connect your code reader/scan tool, and make sure no current, pending, or permanent codes have set.  Also, test all of the power windows, power door locks, power sliding door/liftgate (if equipped), sunroof/moonroof (if equipped), power seats (if equipped), and if the weather is warm enough, test the A/C if that feature is important to you, test the audio system if that feature is important to you.\n\nAnd of course, after you buy it, I would change the engine oil and oil filter, coolant, transmission fluid and filter (drain-and-fill, not a flush), check the brake pads and replace if low.  DIY is best for these things, but if that’s not an option, use a reputable independently-owned shop–not a chain and definitely not a Jiffy Lube-type place.', '\n\n\n Eppersod:\n\nI don’t know the maintenance history\n\n\n\nThink about it:\nThe owner of this vehicle apparently drove it over 50k miles per year, or over 1,000 miles per week.  That type of usage surely doesn’t leave much “downtime” for performing maintenance.   But, perhaps it was properly maintained.   \nIf you can verify that the trans fluid has been changed at least 7 times, and if you can verify that the oil has been changed at least 40 times, then it might be worth considering, in view of the low asking price.   Just be prepared to have to overhaul the transmission in the very near future–even if the fluid was changed 7 times already.', 'As a family car, it should be reliable, and a car with mileage this high won’t be.

I am new here and have been doing research on my next  car. I currently have a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek with a few minor mods (exhaust, wheels, a/t tires, etc…) I love the car and am planning on keeping it. But i am looking for a second vehicle that could also be daily driven if need be and something more thrilling and aggressive. I wanted a hatchback WRX but they no longer make hatchbacks of those vehicles.
I am a car guy, but what I say next will get hate from almost everyone. I do not enjoy manual cars. I get the appeal and why everyone loves them. But for me they’re only fun for 10% of the time I drive and a chore for the rest. That being said, I want something that’s semi-comfortable while still offering a sporty drive.
I have recently gotten a higher paying job and can afford a car that’s a bit higher-end, but not looking for anything crazy. Looking for something in the $40,000 range. I can be tempted to go higher for the right car though. I am also into “badge prestige” like Audi, Mercedes, BMW, etc. I know these brands come with huge downfalls like reliability, maintenance costs, and depreciation; but I’m at a point now where I want a luxury/sporty vehicle regardless of those downfalls. But, that doesn’t mean I’m denying other, more reasonable, suggestions like a new WRX. Or maybe a slightly used Audi SQ5?
So, you can see that there is a very wide range of vehicles I’m interested in. I’m open to all opinions and suggestions. Please help me narrow down  my list.
As a side note: Please don’t bash me because I don’t love manual transmissions. Not everyone has to like what you like. I get enough flack for it, so please be kind. If you don’t have a helpful suggestion then please move onto another topic.

I read your column every Saturday in the newspaper. Today you responded to a letter with the answer for “Romanticizing cars of decades past”, which prompted this question.
I plan to replace my 2006 Impala which I bought new. It now  has 148,000 miles.
My body shop tells me most six cylinders are good for about 200,000 miles and recommends getting rid it by 185,000.
My late husband’s 1988 Lincoln Town Car was a great highway car. I kept it for 27 years until it was getting too expensive to maintain. In 2015 I donated it to charity. I also had 2 others previously, and they were super road cars, too.
My question is that I would like that same ride experience of the old Lincoln Town Cars, but my mechanic is trying to steer me away from Lincoln and recommends a Japanese car. He thinks they are built better.
I have been drooling over the new Continental, but he thinks it is a bad choice.
I also have to make the decision to lease or buy. When I went to see the Lincoln salesman, he said nobody buys luxury vehicles - they lease them.
Between Lincoln and Lexus what would be the points I should consider when making my decision?

Hope you can help me make a decision.
Currently drive a 2001 Mercury Villager with 77K miles on it. The car runs well for being 19 years old, and I’m pretty good at making sure it gets an oil change+ inspection. The van has a good reputation- especially as a joint venture between Ford+Nissan. (Quest Rebadge)
Mechanically I can look forward to:

No record of timing belt change, should probably do that (est. $600)
Mechanic says a motor mount is showing some wear (Est. 300-$400?)
Recharge AC

Recently, my sister offered to sell me her 2004 Pontiac Vibe with 70K miles for a steal at $1800 (well below KBB value). A fairly well praised NUMMi venture between GM+ Toyota (Matrix Redbadge)
She recently had a mechanic inspect the vehicle thoroughly and had some work done including:

Front struts replaced
Battery replaced
Resonator replaced
Vacuum switching valve replaced

Living in Brooklyn, most of my driving are short commutes, with the occasional long holiday drive upstate. On average I’m putting on less than 5000-6000 miles per year.
I’m hoping to drive one of these low miles Asian-American collaborations for the next 2 years while saving up money for a new ride.
From a cost savings perspective, do I put more money into the Merc’ so it keeps on rolling, or do I drop $1800 on the Vibe, which I perceive to be a more reliable car (based on its surprisingly large online fandom who claim 250K miles with nothing but oil changes and tires)
My Mechanics advice “19 years old vs. 16 years old- what’s the difference?”
Tough choices!
Thanks,

Otherwise, I would wait until the vehicle has at least 100,000 miles, and re-evaluate at that time.', '\n\n\n bcohen2010:\n\nAt 77,000 miles, the belt probably will not fail anytime soon\n\n\nTiming belts are replaced by miles or time in months .

Prior to the sale, I test drove it, had a mechanic - friend of my extended family - look at it and run codes and find nothing of concern come up.
The sellers were a young couple - college girl and her older boyfriend, who seemed very nice. The car was given to the girl as a Christmas present from her parents, weeks prior. It was shipped to them from a neighboring state and they said they never really drove it, which I could believe, as it was never registered, although it was titled, in its’ new state. The girl said they were selling it because she wanted to get a used Prius instead - for better gas mileage for her college commute, plus she had no need for the racks and trunk size, since they don’t have any kids or pets, for one thing. They also already have a truck. The previous owners were an older (near elderly) couple, apparently, who didn’t do a whole lot of driving.
The car has 82k miles on it and both the interior and exterior are in very good condition, with only a very few minor knicks, scratches and no dents.
I can change oil and tires, spark plugs and fuses if need be, on my own, but that’s about it. I’m no mechanic, to say the least, but the car seemed fine to me. It runs well, brakes seem very good, and it sounds pretty good when idling. The oil was very clean and it has brand new tires on it. I really like the car, in general, or I wouldn’t have pursued and committed to buying it. I got the sellers to come down on the 
20200102_1732592064×1548 1.29 MB
 price a little bit, too.
My only concern was some amount - not terrible, but some - of corrosion under the hood. The family friend mechanic wasn’t at all bothered by it, nor was my spouse and another family member.
As it’s an 11 year old car, I realize that maybe a certain amount of corrosion is normal, perhaps, especially, considering that it’s spent most of its life in a SE coastal climate (South Carolina and now Florida).
I’m attaching some images of it to give a better idea of what I mean.
Also, what else could I do to check for any issues that may have been missed, initially?
I understand the importance of regular maintenance, but is there anything specific to this year, make and model of Subaru that I might want to keep a close watch over? The mechanic is a sweet guy with years of experience (not sure exactly how many, though) and I am grateful that he took time out to come look at the car, but I am not sure he really knows his Subarus well enough to advise more specifically, beyond running tests and doing a once over. Really, he just told me to make sure to change oil on schedule, which I already know.
Any suggestions or feedback is appreciated.

Last post was about a car I wanted to purchase I got some good feedback which I ended not buying.
So now here I am I currently found a 2005 Honda Civic EX with 25,000 miles I did a Carfax, autocheck, and a title check by a .gov approved site everything came out good, clean title no odometer rollback, although one accident came out in 2008 but it was labeled as minor on all reports. All service has been documented on the reports and the car has been for all it’s time a local car. So I do like the vehicle I’m a college student on a budget. I do not travel far farthest would be 20 miles.
So here I am asking for advice. Would a 2005 Honda Civic with 25k miles be worth buying? It’s selling for $5,000 and my budget is $7,000 would you guys be kind enough to give me your opinions or experience owning an older model Honda. Thank you here is one image of the vehicle.
