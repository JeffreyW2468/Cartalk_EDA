“Car Design and Public Safety” for The New Republic in 1964,

flawed American cars.  His main source was an as-yet unknown Ralph

singled-out the Chevrolet Corvair as particularly unsafe.

splash at first.  But after the book appeared, another New Republic
article by Mr. Ridgeway disclosed that General Motors had hired
detectives to dig up dirt to discredit Mr. Nader as well as
prostitutes who had failed to lure him into compromising
situations.  That news made national headlines.
'An outraged Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of
Connecticut, called a Senate hearing, and G.M.‘s president, James
Roche, admitted to the misdeeds and apologized to Mr. Nader, who went
on to become an overnight hero of the consumer movement.  His book shot
to the top of best-seller lists, and Congress enacted the National

government to set and enforce new vehicular and traffic safety
standards.’

It was dark and the object was black, possibly a car part, so I didn’t see until I was almost right on top of it. I heard a couple quick thuds and could feel it hit my undercarriage. I pulled over at a gas station and couldn’t find any damage to the front of my car or on the wheels, and nothing seemed to be amiss on the back end either. But still I’m wondering how worried I should be about damage to the undercarriage? As far as I can tell the car is still driving fine.

Dangers of Driving While High
Nearly 5% of US adults reported driving under the influence of marijuana in 2018, according to a CDC report.





","['And 8% under the influence of alcohol.\nAnd ??% under the influence of a distraction.', 'Whether you drive under the influence of a controlled substance is a mark of whether you’re a functioning addict or just an addict.  (Yes, I know marijuana isn’t physically addictive, but it is mentally addictive.  When used daily, it affects your brain chemistry, effectively becoming self-medicating for depression.)\nA functioning addict is the guy who drinks a six pack each evening, or the woman who drinks a bottle of wine each evening, or the person who smokes a little weed after they put the kids to bed and settles down in front of the TV at night.  They wait until they’re home for the day and not planning to go anywhere before they have their first drink or puff.  Functioning addicts pay their bills on time, and they don’t miss work because they’re hungover.  They don’t take stupid risks that put their loved ones in jeopardy.\nIf you wake-and-bake in the morning, or can’t wait until you’re home for the evening to take your first mind-altering substance, regardless of what it is, you have a problem, and if you don’t believe me, you also have a problem with denial.', 'And I’ll bet the actual number is a lot higher.

It’s caused me to change my “legalize drugs” stance to “legalize drugs, but if you have to smoke the drug, you can only do it at home.” I would extend this to tobacco products as well, in an ideal world.\n\n\n\n Cavell:\n\nwould you apply for a job if they said you could not drink alcohol on weekends?\n\n\nThere are some jobs like that. Standby pilots can’t drink unless they’re released from being on call for a day, because they don’t know when they’re gonna be called to substitute for a scheduled pilot. The federal law is 8 hours between your last drink and flying, but many airlines push that to 12 hours. If they drink, they risk getting called out during that window and having to turn down the trip.\nI do think we need to be a little careful (and we have been through this before) about who we are branding an addict. Someone who has a glass of wine at a restaurant is not waiting to get home until they drink, but they are also not an alcoholic just because they had wine with dinner. Claiming addiction when none exists is not helpful to the cause.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nSomeone who has a glass of wine at a restaurant is not waiting to get home until they drink, but they are also not an alcoholic just because they had wine with dinner.\n\n\nI agree, and that is why I carefully made the distinction of saying someone who cannot wait until they get home to get their fix has an issue.  If you have a designated driver, and choose to have a bottle of wine with your dinner at a restaurant, I have no problem with that kind of responsible use.  I also have no problem with responsible adults who drink a glass of wine with dinner and then drive an hour after consuming the drink.\nIn the end, it’s pretty easy to say, “no thanks, I’m driving, but you go ahead and order a drink for yourself; I can wait until we get home.”', '\n\n\n Cavell:\n\nwould you apply for a job if they said you could not drink alcohol on weekends?\n\n\nI don’t know of any company that does that.

My company will deny employment because of weed because we have contracts with the Federal government and weed is still a federal crime. We have contracts with the Feds and they dictate some or our rules.', 'Isn’t Bud owned by the Dutch now like Shell?  They are supposed to be woke.\nThe other thing with pot is that it is not only illegal still in some states, but it tends to stay in the body for some days/weeks afterwards.  It’s not like alcohol that after 12 hours or so there is no trace and no effect.  It also still remains to be seen whether there are long term brain changes due to the use of pot.

39,Do “Move Over” laws cause as many incidents as they prevent?,Safety,[],Rod-Knox,"['jtsanders', 'wentwest', 'boilerengtn', 'shadowfax', 'BillRussell', 'auto-owner', 'Bing', 'tom418', 'TwinTurbo', 'VDCdriver', 'Mustangman', 'VOLVO-V70']","In the last few years, many states have passed laws requiring drivers to either move over or slow down when passing cars or road work or pulled over vehicles in the emergency or breakdown lane. In concept, a good idea; it gives road crews, law enforcement, or someone changing a tire a little more margin of safety. In practice what I see too many times is drivers thinking that their only option is to “move over,” many times right in front of or nearly running into others. I saw this happen today and have seen it happen many other times as well.
What has been your experiences with this law, if it’s in your state? If you have an article or paper on the topic, please include a link if you have one at hand.","['My state, Florida, also has this law and it makes people punch the brakes and change lanes from the right to the middle without looking. In heavy traffic it takes a severe toll, causing wrecks usually with multiple cars.

Idiots will idiot. If the law didn’t exist then the idiots would blow past the guys on the side of the road at 20 over and hit one of 'em."", 'The law is good, the only problem I have is this situation:\nThree lane highway with a lane ahead is closed due to construction. A cop is sitting in the lane just before the closure with his lights blinking to warn drivers.\nBut if you take the law as it stands, you have to move over two lanes so the 3 lane highway is reduced to one lane. Of course no one does this.', 'I agree these laws are at least as bad as they are good, partly because of the shocking number of drivers who seem to think others should somehow anticipate their lane changes.', 'In Minnesota we haven’t had any highway patrol hit by driver in the left lane, so that’s a good thing.  The thing is when you see the flashing lights both lanes need to be aware an let people move over.  I have had instances where folks in the left lane just sit there blocking me so I can’t move over.  I’m not going to say which state most of them are from.', 'Reading the above responses, it sounds like either the law is written differently in other states or it’s still misunderstood. In Tennessee, you move over only if it is safe to do so. If it’s not safe to move over, all you are required to do is slow down.\nWhat I’ve seen on a number of occasions is drivers moving over when there really is not enough space, causing many others to take evasive action, when simply lifting off the gas is all that is needed. Thankfully, I’ve not seen an accident - yet.\nIn my mind, “safe to move over” means there is A LOT of space - like 10 car lengths. And slowing down means slowing down 5 mph or less, especially if you’re in a group.\nThe law has a good intent. Implementation has had a lot of unintended consequences, however.', 'The situation seems to be caused by a conflict between timid and aggressive drivers and the “move over” laws support the aggressive drivers. It’s ironic that the timid often remain in the ‘passing’ lane because if they move to the right the aggressive drivers will rarely allow them back to the left when they find themselves behind even slower traffic. That situation seems quite obvious to me.\nedit- but I do realize that those timid drivers feel they should be able to signal a move to the left as they continue at their 5mph under the posted limit and expect traffic approaching at 10mph over to immediately slow to allow them to move over and pass in a snail race.', 'In Maryland, drivers must slow down for emergency vehicles with their emergency lights on, or pull into the next lane away from the incident. The speed is not specified if you have to stay in the lane, but I’ve heard about 10 mph below the posted speed limit. Around here, the only time you find 10 car length separation is about 2am. The best we can hope for here is about 5 car lengths. I pull over if I can, but I won’t if it is dangerous. If I have to slow from 65 in a 55 zone to 45, it might cost me 20 seconds or so. People that can’t handle that have a problem they need to address.', '\n\n\n wentwest:\n\nIt’s not the fault of the laws, it’s the brainless drivers who never even gave a thought to what to do in an emergency, besides slam on the brakes.\n\n\n+1\nAnd, in addition to the reality that so many people seem to care very little about how their driving impacts (no pun intended) others, we have another reality, namely that all-too-many drivers don’t look very far ahead on the highway, and are then… taken by surprise… by circumstances that they should have seen far earlier than when they finally became aware of it.', 'Another situation where one law with good intention can cause a situation:\nIn Connecticut, a motorist is required to leave 5 feet between his/her car and a bicyclist, when passing the bicycle.\nI frequently have drivers crossing the double yellow line on two lane roads, coming into my lane where they clearly would have had ten feet without even moving over.', '\n\n\n wentwest:\n\nIt’s not the fault of the laws, it’s the brainless drivers who never even gave a thought to what to do in an emergency, besides slam on the brakes.\n\n\nLaws should consider the behavior of those affected. These laws are not well written nor well understood by many drivers.\nI agree with the laws in principle and I have the capacity to easily follow them but many don’t. The unintended consequence of these laws is exposing that many drivers don’t look ahead, don’t properly change lanes and really have no clue how to drive.\nHow do we change the law to maintain the safety of law enforcement at the side of the road while recognizing the limitations of the clueless drivers? After all, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.', 'Laws assume the “reasonable person” when they are written.  They are generally written by committees that are made up of reasonably intelligent, reasonably literate people who have a lot of agendas.  What comes out isn’t always pretty, and over many years of human buffoonery all the mistakes, oversights and assumptions show up.  That’s why we have courts - to try to iron out all those wrinkles.  It ain’t easy.\nAnd the average IQ is 100, so half the population is lower than that, and poorly thought out behavior is completely normal.  “Reasonable” turns out to be pretty unreasonable.', 'Travelling down the IQ road will not explain the negative behavior. Some of the worst drivers I’ve ever ridden with had PhD’s, MD’s or JD’s - not exactly the sub-100 IQ group. There are studies that suggest that lower IQ drivers may be better drivers. The courts don’t need to iron out any wrinkles here because the law is very clear. It is a matter of human behavior.\nOK, let’s focus on how the various groups (my choice of groups) are affected.\nGroup 1) Looks far ahead, anticipates well, can lane change seamlessly - These folks are not affected by the laws because they are not a risk.\nGroup 2) Is generally a decent driver, doesn’t anticipate others, generally looks ahead and can get out of the way of trouble without causing more - These folks might be affected by the laws as reminded by road signs. These are the drivers on which the law may have some affect but they are fairly low risk drivers to begin with.\nGroup 3) Generally distracted, looks ahead 25 feet, texting while driving, yakking on the phone, wandering out of their lane (Bots Dots should tell them this, at least in Florida, home of the Ray Charles Driving School) - These are the folks that are affected by the by the law in a negative fashion in so much as they are the very folks were are complaining about and would be most likely to cause a wreck or injure roadside workers.\nThe law has no affect on group 1, a positive affect on group 2 and a negative affect on the 3rd group. The law is in place, so these folks can be ticketed, if there is another officer in the area. If they cause a wreck, they would have been cited under existing laws. I don’t see these laws as a solution to anything.', '\n\n\n Mustangman:\n\nHow do we change the law to maintain the safety of law enforcement at the side of the road while recognizing the limitations of the clueless drivers?\n\n\nStart ticketing those that do not follow the rules. Word gets around, even among the Densa membership…', '\n\n\n TwinTurbo:\n\nStart ticketing those that do not follow the rules\n\n\nThat is the usual procedure but has anyone here ever seen extra enforcement on the scene to actually accomplish this? Especially in high traffic areas that have the largest affect.\nThat’s a real question, not a rhetorical one, I’d like to hear from the posters. I personally have not seen a “sting” set up to enforce that.\nI haven’t even seen any of the millions of gray or white cars that always seem to ignore the “lights on in rain” laws in many states pulled over either!  ', 'My personal opinion is that the ’ move over law ’ causes very few accidents. I do feel it has prevented some injuries or worse. I did see one person pulled over after they passed an officer with a stopped car. As for doing stings for that I doubt it.', 'There’s a little bit more to it. If the drive is going substantially over the speed limit, he may only be able to slow to the speed limit even when braking heavily. These guys also come upon emergency vehicles much faster than the rest of us. They change lanes seamlessly because they have a lot of practice. They anticipate reasonably well because they haven’t killed themselves yet. These 90 mph wonders are much more likely to get themselves in a bind because the difference in speed is so great. They may not be able to bail out to the next lane over when they try to pass traffic in the outboard lanes. I don’t think they fit into any of the three categories you list. Can we add one?', ""Yes we can add one!  That is a driver type I see pretty frequently that I forgot. They generally seem quite a bit more aware that groups 2 or 3 but the speed makes them a hazard, as you so effectively explain.\nCall 'em group 4. That’s a group easy for law enforcement to target.

Wirecutter: Reviews for the Real World



What to Buy: Dash Cams That Can Back You Up in an Accident 2
After a car accident, a dash cam can be your most reliable—and, often, only—eyewitness to prove it wasn’t your fault. Here are the models we recommend.





","['I’m surprised that dash cams haven’t become a standard or at least optional feature on new cars.  But since technology always keeps newer and better versions coming out, as with cell phones and navigation apps and computers, what would be handy is having a standardized power system in place in cars for easy plug and go of a car owner’s preferred dash cam model easily changed out for a different version without having to mess with routing and securing wiring to not obscure vision or otherwise get in the way.', 'They do have one, it used to br called the cigarette lighter plug.', 'I think Marnet is talking about the power cord not being in the way.  When using my GPS the cord is dangling around the dash or looped over the rear view mirror.', '\n\n\n Marnet:\n\nI’m surprised that dash cams haven’t become a standard or at least optional feature on new cars.\n\n\nIf my attorney father were still alive, he’d cringe at the idea. Recording everything means you might get evidence against someone else, true. But it also means you’re collecting evidence against yourself, so unless you’re a 100% perfect driver 100% of the time, you’re assuming risk by running that camera.', 'I like to keep my car very neat inside, so I agree that some sort of standard power and mounting system by the rear view mirror would be nice. A magnetic mount with wireless charging would be ideal. I’d buy a dashcam today if this existed.\nI’d also like to see some sort of standard enclosure (black-colored) for a toll transponder in that area.', 'I’ve been using a Dashcam app on my IPhone. Haven’t had to use it in court yet (and hope I never have to). But it does exactly what I want and need.', 'Where would you find any metal on the dash in today’s car’s to mount to use a magnetic mount?', 'I think you’re missing the point. We’re discussing how manufacturers should add a neat way to mount a dashcam.\nEdit: This was a reply to Renegade, but it’s not showing as such for some reason.', 'As noted, I was speculating about there being an effective way to mount such devices without dangling cord or looped over the mirror, etc.\nAnd despite my statement that I’m surprised dash cams haven’t become a standardized option on cars, given the plethora of other distracting electronic options, I don’t think that I’d want one as it would be a visual obstruction to and distraction in my driving field of vision.', 'Agree need a way mount but not magnetic with all plastic in today’s car’s it need’s to be another way.', '\n\n\n Renegade:\n\nAgree need a way mount but not magnetic with all plastic in today’s car’s it need’s to be another way.\n\n\nAgain, you don’t understand. You’re talking about today’s cars. We’re talking about things that the manufacturer should add in tomorrow’s cars. The manufacturer could add a magnetic mount in or near the rear view mirror for easy attachment and detachment.', 'Under stand now thought you was talking about car’s that are on the road now sorry about the mis understaning.', 'To be fair, there’s parallel discussion here of what is and what might be.\nThe thread began with an article about which dash cams are best and what to look for when choosing one to put into current existing vehicles.  Included in that article is mention of mounting and powering a dash cam and inherent hassles in how to secure the power cord out of the way whether by DIY or having installation done by a retailer.\nThen I commented wondering about dash cams accomodation becoming a standardized integrated option in future cars and that I’m surprised it isn’t already so.  I assume that it will be a built in feature on self-driving cars given those rely on a series of cameras feeding info to the computer controlling a self-driving vehicle.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nBut it also means you’re collecting evidence against yourself, so unless you’re a 100% perfect driver 100% of the time, you’re assuming risk by running that camera.\n\n\nYep.  If you enjoy driving 5-10 MPH over the speed limit, the camera will catch it for posterity.  That’s one reason I decided to stop using my dashcam in my car.  Also, if I was going to use one, I’d actually want two, one pointing backwards to catch tailgaters on camera.\n\n\n\n Renegade:\n\nWhere would you find any metal on the dash in today’s car’s to mount to use a magnetic mount?\n\n\nThe one I bought has a suction cup that attaches to the inside of the windshield.  I decided to use it as a home security camera after my car got hit-and-run at my apartment complex.  I set it to detect motion and record over the oldest stored video.  If my car ever gets hit while parked again, I’ll be able to turn the video over to the police.', '\n\n\n Marnet:\n\nAs noted, I was speculating about there being an effective way to mount such devices without dangling cord or looped over the mirror, etc.\n\n\nI happen to open the dash and back-attach the [modified] charger to the back of the lighter socket and then ran wire in a hidden way all the way to the top, mirror area.\nIt was NOT the easy thing to do.\nI would greatly appreciate some better connector available and form-factor better than antiquated lighter socket.', '\n\n\n Whitey:\n\nAlso, if I was going to use one, I’d actually want two, one pointing backwards to catch tailgaters on camera.\n\n\nI’ve seen multiple dashcams for sale on Amazon which have the second camera to point to the back, either embedded into one body, or as a separate add-on unit, working through the same electronics.', 'Just curious, If you have a dash cam and were in an accident are you required to turn it over?', 'As far as mounting dash cam’s would they work mounted on the dash as well as the mirror after all they are called dash cam’s not mirror cam’s?', 'My wife’s Ford Edge has 2 front facing cameras and 1 rear. Why can’t they simply provide a way to save the data?']",25,1.2k

More not needed govt intervention  and potential problem points in vehicles .', 'I’m liking the idea of a fully integrated system. First you breathe into a test tube to detect any illegal substances. Next, you have to pass a short exam asking things like, it’s OK to text and drive if you can handle it, turn signals are for wimps, speed limits are only a suggestion etc. Finally, you have to sequentially step on the gas pedal and brake with the same foot before the engine will start…', 'They could call it a stupid detector.', 'just their way of trying to prevent 10K+ deaths a year by dwi drivers maybe', 'If you want to drink yourself to death in your home, at the bar, etc…by all means go for it, the government shouldn’t have any input in that decision. But because you can get drunk, get behind the wheel of a car, and kill me and/or my family, you’re now infringing on my right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That’s where the government can (and should) get involved.\nSame goes for texting or any other driver impairment. Driving is not a right, it is a privilege, and the government should do anything and everything to ensure its safety.', '\n\n\n Bing:\n\nMaybe they will come up with something that detects pot or meth or reading the newspaper.\n\n\nAround here now that POT is legal…it’s becoming a concern.\nAt least just getting the drunks off the road is a good step in the right direction. On average more then 30 people a day were killed by impaired drivers.', 'I’m curious how the breath detection will differentiate between me and my passenger. If my passenger is falling-down drunk and I am stone cold sober and already annoyed at having to chauffeur a drunk idiot around, I’m going to be apoplectic if my car decides I’m too drunk to drive.\nAt any rate, there are 4x as many deaths from guns per year as from drunks. It would be nice if the politicians would solve problems in the order of how many deaths those problems cause. And I don’t just mean drunk driving - politicians are trying to get a movement started to ban or severely restrict flights of historic aircraft because of the B17 that crashed a few weeks ago. That killed 7 people, and resulted in calls to ban flights of old planes. But kill 40,000 people with guns and it just gets a collective shrug and some mumbling about thoughts and prayers.\nPriorities.', '\n\n\n BikeGuy88:\n\nThat’s where the government can (and should) get involved.\n\n\nSince it IS illegal to drive impaired, the government IS involved. This is an ineffective method as well as a step too far, legally. If the average age of a car on US roads is 11 years, it would take decades for this to have a significant effect.\nThere are far larger killers that are going largely ignored that need tending to before this. How about dealing with the 3rd largest killer in the US? That would be medical errors estimated to be over 250,000 a year.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nAt any rate, there are 4x as many deaths from guns per year as from drunks.\n\n\nAnd a good portion of those gun deaths - alcohol was involved.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nIt would be nice if the politicians would solve problems in the order of how many deaths those problems cause\n\n\nOh here we go again.  You need to first look at how many of those deaths were suicides, then of the remaining how many were gang related, and you’ll see how insignificant the rest is considering how many were for self preservation.', '\n\n\n MikeInNH:\n\nAnd a good portion of those gun deaths - alcohol was involved.\n\n\nAre you suggesting that installing breathalyzers in cars will prevent alcohol-related gun deaths? If not, I don’t see your point.\n\n\n\n Bing:\n\nYou need to first look at how many of those deaths were suicides, then of the remaining how many were gang related\n\n\nNo, I don’t, because I don’t care. They’re still dead because of guns. I’m not sure why you think “gang-related” deaths are somehow OK as compared to other types of deaths. I don’t.\nEven if you remove the suicides, the deaths are still higher than those killed by drunks, but, gee, we can’t do anything about it for some obscure reason.\nAt any rate, lest you think otherwise, I’m not arguing for a blanket gun ban instead of a blanket DWI oppression scheme. I’m arguing that we should solve the problem that results in 40,000 deaths before we solve the problem that results in 10,000 deaths. I’m also arguing that we should actually solve the drunk driving problem.\nDrug addicts - and I include habitual drunk drivers in that category - can be fiendishly clever when you get between them and their drug. They will come out with activated charcoal masks, or find a way to disable the system entirely, or in some other manner figure out how to drive while drunk. At the very least, they’ll simply avoid buying a car that has the drunk-detector installed. All of this will result in those of us who do not have an alcohol abuse problem being inconvenienced while those who do keep driving unimpeded because they’ve circumvented the barriers. We’re all now paying more for cars and suffering more inconveniences in order to foist a program that won’t work on the driving public. Stupid.\nMeanwhile people with more than a dozen DWI convictions are still walking (and driving) around free. That doesn’t make sense. Instead of inconveniencing the vast majority of us who do not drive drunk, while bending over backwards to see that those who do face as little consequence as possible for their bad behavior, we should target the actual criminals.\nYour first offense should result in the confiscation of your car (not the car you were in that you borrowed from your friend, but the one (or more) that you actually own) and a 1 year license suspension where you must be evaluated by a trained mental health professional, and you can’t get your license back until they sign off on it.\nViolating the license suspension should send you to jail, as should your second DWI (and needless to say, you should lose your license again, this time permanently).\nWe have such a massive drunk driving problem in this country because we keep turning the drunks loose and then they go get smashed and get behind the wheel again. Statistics show that 1 DWI means the person is much more likely to get a future DWI than the guy who has never gotten one in the first place. In other words, the recidivism rate is sky-high. It’s fairly likely that the guy the cop busts for DWI has done it before, and we’re not doing anything about that. But we’re delighted to call for universal breath tests that will harass and annoy innocent people who have not and will never get a DWI.\nIt’s the same mentality that led to us all taking our shoes off at the airport. One idiot had an explosive in a shoe that wouldn’t even have worked, and now we’re all suspected Nike-bombing terrorists. I’m personally tired of being under constant suspicion because some other jerk did something bad.\nRather than assume I, with no DWIs on my record, am about to drive drunk, how about we focus on the people who actually do?', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nAre you suggesting that installing breathalyzers in cars will prevent alcohol-related gun deaths? If not, I don’t see your point.\n\n\nOf course not…But in some states it’s not against the law to carry and be drunk. IMHO - if you’re drunk and you’re carrying - Same punishment as a DUI.\nI’m one of those people who’s not for taking guns away from people. But I firmly believe we need tougher laws to prevent people from easily buying any weapon they want. All gun transactions (public or private) need a background check. If you sell someone a gun without doing a background check and that person commits a crime with that gun, then you should be held just as responsible for that crime as the person committing the crime. You want to be a responsible gun owner…then take responsibility when you sell that gun. Right now it’s way too easy for anyone to get a gun in this country. I also think certain guns should be banned. Even Ronald Reagan was against citizens from owning assault style weapons and believed in background checks.\nRon Reagan on Gun Control - Feb 6, 1989', 'What a stupid idea, and one that will add unnecessary cost and complexity to new cars–without making so much as a dent in the problem of drunk/drugged/distracted driving.  First of all, way more deaths/injuries/accidents are caused by people playing with their cellphone while driving than driving under the influence of drugs/alcohol.  Another major cause–and one that I have personally experienced–is driving while tired.  Many of the deaths and injuries that do occur could have been avoided if people simply wore their seat belts.\nSecond, most people who would drive under the influence of drugs/alcohol are poor enough that they drive the cheapest, most beat-up used car–often with minimal or no insurance–and not the “latest and greatest” models.  It would take decades for models with this type of technology to “trickle down” to such a price point, if they are even capable of lasting that long.  It is very probable that there will come a time where more cars from the 1990s are on the road every day than the number of cars from the 2010 decade that still run.\nThird, and most importantly, I am tired of Big Brother watching me, and would consider the presence of this type of “feature” a deal-breaker even though I never drink or use drugs.', 'Yep onward onward to the goal of eliminating all deaths from any cause.   Then we will be safe, and done.', '\n\n\n MikeInNH:\n\nIMHO - if you’re drunk and you’re carrying - Same punishment as a DUI.\n\n\nWe’re on pretty much the same page, sounds like.\n\n\n\n bcohen2010:\n\nIt would take decades for models with this type of technology to “trickle down” to such a price point, if they are even capable of lasting that long.\n\n\nAnd when the car lasts that long, the breathalyzer system (which presumably involves a starter-kill function) is probably gonna do as well as most starter-kill alarms and start flaking out. In other words, the Mormon who’s never touched a drink in his life isn’t gonna be able to start his car because the stupid system broke and won’t release the starter kill. The whole concept is ridiculous.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nIn other words, the Mormon who’s never touched a drink in his life isn’t gonna be able to start his car because the stupid system broke and won’t release the starter kill.\n\n\nAnd it will probably be a federal crime to remove or bypass it. Just like catalytic converters.', 'I was wondering when you were going to post this, @RandomTroll.\nI support these devices being mandated for first time offenders who haven’t killed anyone yet.  I know it is controversial, but when it comes to drinking and driving, I’m against it.']",29,761

But according to William E. Van Tassel, the manager of driver training programs at AAA's headquarters in Heathrow, Fla., ""We really have gotten away from that.""
The driver with the blinding high beams might be impaired by alcohol. Flashing your own high beams, particularly at night, could make that person's vision, possibly already diminished by drinking and darkness, even worse, Mr. Van Tassel said.

He also advised against flashing your lights because of the dangers of  the so-called moth effect, which occurs when drivers are mesmerized by bright or flashing lights and head in the direction they are looking. Flashing your lights could also be interpreted as an act of aggression.

Hmmm… I still thought this was the rule.  I remember flashing my brights on a guy who I thought had his on.  When he flashed back, I saw that they weren’t his brights, just a lot brighter than I’m used to.

Sometimes drivers at a four-way stop flash their lights to signal others to go ahead.
Never heard this one, wouldn't trust it.

'A Trumbull County (Ohio) sheriff's deputy pulled over an Amish buggy on Donley Road early on the morning of Sept. 15 after the officer noticed a few oddities about the vehicle. For one, there were two Amish men inside who were drinking, and on the buggy's roof rode a 12-pack of beer. And, according to Fox 8, the old-fashioned conveyance sported an unlikely modern convenience: a stereo system with large speakers. As soon as the buggy came to a stop, the two men jumped out and escaped into heavy woods near the road. Meanwhile, the horse, trailing the buggy, took off. The officer was able to catch up with the horse and have the buggy towed; the drivers were still at large.

Then turn the key one position from on to accessory, brake to a stop and shift into park.  For me that response is wrong on so many counts.

A blown engine from shifting into neutral is far more acceptable than a high speed crash (IMO).
If you’re still in drive, depending upon how much power your engine is making and how much brake pad you have left, you may not be able to stop the car before your brakes are gone.

Most modern cars no longer have an ignition key, but rather a fob and a push button.

Regarding # 3 above, the questions become: a)  if you can/do shift into neutral, will the engine shut off if you push the button, and b)  if the engine does shut off, will that lock the steering wheel?
I have always heard that the first thing you should do if you’re driving and your throttle sticks is to shift into neutral (as noted in #1 above), then begin braking, move to the side of the road and then shut of the car.

Toyota was one of the last to add “brake override”,  and in the wake of their “runaway cars” incidents, they even recalled older cars in order to install it.\nHere is a video from Consumer Reports on this very issue, and their advice remains…\nShift into neutral and apply the brake.\nHow ""brake override"" stops runaway cars | Consumer Reports\n', 'I’m with you that I’d rather have a blown engine than kill someone, but knowing my car has a rev limiter, that’s not even a concern.\nThe chance of experiencing uncontrolled acceleration is pretty remote already, but it’s not so remote that it’s not prudent to think about and practice what you’d do if it happens. On the other hand, asking, “What if I can’t shift to neutral?” strikes me as paranoid.\nIt’s kind of like asking, “What if my engine explodes with no warning signs beforehand?” Sure, it could happen, but the chance is so remote that there is little point in planning for it.

If a millionaire gets a ticket, he pays and doesn’t even notice the money is gone. If a minimum wage recipient gets it, he has to choose between paying rent and paying the ticket.\nWhy should low-income drivers be penalized proportionally more than the wealthy speeder?\nThere’s also an argument to be made that late fees, non-payment fines, etc sound good to the obtuse but in actuality are stupid. “You can’t afford to pay this ticket and so as a result we’re going to charge you even more money.”\nNo one should spiral into bankruptcy because of a speeding ticket. It should hurt, but not mortally wound. The justice system is already heavily weighted in favor of the rich. Is it really necessary to keep sticking it to the poor, even when it’s a 10-over ticket?\nSeparately, I bet the author would enjoy Wisconsin. I don’t know if they’re still doing it because I haven’t lived there for a long time, but I got a ticket there once, and the cop wanted me to pay it right then, on the side of the road. He told me he’d arrest me if I didn’t. He ended up letting me go with a promise-to-appear after I asked him if he’d ever heard of the 6th amendment and was he really willing to stake his career and departmental budget on the notion that he wouldn’t lose the lawsuit. But I’m sure a lot of people just paid up so they wouldn’t go to jail, either because they didn’t know their constitutional rights or because they just didn’t want to deal with the hassle.\nSomething to keep in mind is that cops often operate under the assumption that people will just pay, and so sometimes they give out questionable tickets. I got a ticket once in Minnesota that I fought and got thrown out. At the time stationary radar required 2 seconds to lock on and verify the target’s speed. The cop dutifully noted that the radar locked after 2 seconds and had me speeding. In court, I got the cop to admit to where he was positioned, which was just after a sharp curve in the road. I then showed mathematically that in order for the radar to have 2 seconds to lock onto me between me coming around the curve, and passing the cop, I’d have had to be doing 20 under. Some cops fudge when they want to write tickets, and the success rate in getting people to just pay means they aren’t incentivized to stop.\nI saw a recent video from, I think, Albuquerque. Body-cam of a cop catching a (low income) speeder, and arresting her. But there was no record of the driver’s speed because that cop didn’t have radar. The cop claimed “Well I had to do 90 to catch you so you were going really fast.”\nOf course, even at 45 mph I’ll be far enough ahead of the cop by the time she turns around that she’ll have to go really fast if she wants to catch me. But this low income person went to jail, doubtless got lots of citations to justify the arrest that she’ll either have to pay for or fight, and she might have lost her job, all because a police officer decided that people who irritate her should go to jail.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nWhy should low-income drivers be penalized proportionally more than the wealthy speeder?\n\n\nBecause it’s the cost of the violation. I take a different view. If you can’t afford a ticket, you should be extra diligent in not putting yourself into a position to get one. Nobody forces you to speed or run red lights etc. It’s a choice. Now deal with the consequences of your actions.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nof a cop catching a (low income) speeder, and arresting her\n\n\nHow do you know the person was \'low income?""  How would the police know? Was this known at the time of the stop or later after she was arrested? Curious how that determination was made.\nI was given a speeding ticket many years ago based on a “visual estimate” of the officer. These have been challenged in court and the results upheld in favor of the police. Based on the fact I was rolling almost 90 when he saw me coming the other way on a curve and the car yawed a bit when braked heavily, I can’t fault him. I got a ticket for 10 or 15 over (forget) rather than the 35 over I was actually going. So there wasn’t much argument.', '\n\n\n Mustangman:\n\nHow do you know the person was \'low income?""\n\n\nBecause she said on video that she’s a hairdresser, and was clearly worried about being fired which means she doesn’t own the salon. Not a whole lot of those are millionaires. \n\n\n\n TwinTurbo:\n\nIf you can’t afford a ticket, you should be extra diligent in not putting yourself into a position to get one.\n\n\nI’ve already given one example of a cop flat-out lying to write a ticket that should never have been written. That’s not unique.\nThat aside, the flip-side of your argument is that if you can afford it, feel free to break the law as often as you want. The idea that the rich get to break laws whenever they want simply because they have lots of money has been in the news a lot lately, and public opinion doesn’t generally tend to favor that notion.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nI do think we’d be better structuring traffic fine violations the way some Nordic countries do, which is basing the dollar amount on the person’s wealth.\n\n\nTotally disagree, the law should apply to everyone equally. I get that a $200 fine would impact a poorer person more than a wealthy one. But I that wealthier person may have made better choices in life than the poorer person did, and shouldn’t be penalized for it.\n\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nWhy should low-income drivers be penalized proportionally more than the wealthy speeder?\n\n\nIt should be an incentive to reach a point where a $200 speeding ticket is no big deal.\n\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nThere’s also an argument to be made that late fees, non-payment fines, etc sound good to the obtuse but in actuality are stupid. “You can’t afford to pay this ticket and so as a result we’re going to charge you even more money.”\n\n\nThat is a problem, I’m not sure what the best alternative is though. Something has to be done, you can’t just say “well you can’t pay so, I guess you get off scot-free.” But at the same time, you don’t want to take away a person’s only way to get to work either.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nthat she’s a hairdresser, and was clearly worried about being fired\n\n\nWell that is a bit of a stereotype isn’t it? Plus without more data it may be wrong. Average pay for a hairdresser is $21.8K tp $32.4K a year. Low income for a single person is between $11.5K and $22.8K. Cost of living in ABQ is slightly less than the national average. And her family status is unknown, so, she may be officially low income, she may not.\nAnd the cop didn’t know that before he pulled her over, only after.\nBottom line is very simple. Don’t break the law any more than the folks around you and you won’t create that unfortunate relationship with the legal community.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nfeel free to break the law as often as you want.\n\n\nNo, there are also points associated with tickets. So if you keep doing it, you lose your license privileges.\nThat being said, the rich have always had advantages like this. They tend to consume far more of the resources on the planet than those less fortunate. That doesn’t mean I’m willing to forego the idea of personal responsibility which has already been taken way beyond reasonable IMHO. Rather than giving breaks to “poor” people, rather we should strive to hold “rich” people accountable. That does not include higher fines just because you can afford it…', 'Where we live traffic enforcement by and large fair. Our main problem is that construction crews don’t remove the lower speed limit signs after the construction is finished forcing everyone to slow to 30 mph unnecessarily.\nIn other countries I’ve been enforcement can be totally arbitrary. A government friend was arrested in Abu Dhabi for having the temerity of passing a local Sheik driving in his Rolls Royce without even exceeding the speed limit!!! My friend was driving a lowly C Class Mercedes with diplomatic plates…', '\n\n\n FoDaddy:\n\nTotally disagree, the law should apply to everyone equally.\n\n\nThen you should agree, because $200 isn’t much of a punishment to a millionaire, but it’s devastating to someone living in poverty.\n\n\n\n FoDaddy:\n\nBut I that wealthier person may have made better choices in life than the poorer person did\n\n\nOr maybe he inherited all his money from Daddy and because society worships people with money he’s been taught all his life that he can do whatever he wants and just throw some money at it to make the consequences go away.\nFurther, you’re implying that poor people are poor because of bad decisions they made. That’s certainly true in some cases, but not all. There are plenty of people out there who made all the right decisions and were responsible, middle-class adults, and then got cancer and went broke because we’ve decided that healthcare, too, is a profit center.\nAnd now society wants to pile on to their misfortune by disproportionally punishing them when they get a speeding ticket. That’s not OK.\n\n\n\n Mustangman:\n\nLow income for a single person is between $11.5K and $22.8K\n\n\nFunny you should mention that. I was making just barely $23k in my first job out of college, in one of the cheaper places to live in the upper midwest, more than 20 years ago. I barely managed to make ends meet. It’s expensive to be poor. You have to rent bad apartments with bad insulation and leaky windows so your heating bills are sky high even if you keep the thermostat set at 50. You can’t buy anything of quality which means you’re constantly replacing things that more well-off people don’t have to. And the $100 ticket I got for 1 over (yes, one over) hurt, a lot.\nIn short, the idea that $22.8 is “upper-middle-poor” is laughable real-world, and just because I’m now light years ahead of my income level back then doesn’t mean I’ve lost the ability to understand what it’s like.\n\n\n\n Mustangman:\n\nDon’t break the law any more than the folks around you and you won’t create that unfortunate relationship with the legal community.\n\n\nI’ve now given several examples of cops being jerks in their “enforcement” activities. Sometimes you get in trouble even if you aren’t breaking the law. And by the way, a cop is much more likely to pull over the guy in the 30 year old junker than he is the guy in the brand new Lexus. Part of that, I suspect, is because he knows the guy in the junker is an easier target who probably won’t fight back and the cop won’t face any blowback from meeting his quota.\n\n\n\n TwinTurbo:\n\nNo, there are also points associated with tickets.\n\n\nThat isn’t universally true. My state does not have a points system, nor do several others. And in the states that do, it’s not uncommon for well-off defendants to get themselves a traffic lawyer and plead down to a non-moving violation to avoid earning points.\n\n\n\n TwinTurbo:\n\nRather than giving breaks to “poor” people, rather we should strive to hold “rich” people accountable. That does not include higher fines just because you can afford it…\n\n\nThen what would you suggest? How do we hold them accountable to a similar degree as the poor person we’re eagerly holding accountable if not by making their lawbreaking hurt just as much as it hurts the broke guy?', 'Rather than fines increasing with income, why not have fines increase with number of violations?  First speeding ticket is less, second ticket (within a certain time period) is more, etc.\nI get the argument that a $200 fine to a millionaire is chump change. But so is the price of a good meal, or the price of a new car. That’s why people like to have a lot of money rather than be poor.', 'I get the impression that for many “poor” is their less preferred but more socially acceptable alternatives to “lazy” and “irresponsible.”  But I once was cited for failure to come to a complete stop and went to court to contest it and found that the city traffic court was a kangaroo court that was very determined to inflict as much grief as possible on ‘outlaws’ who were ticketed for the most minor of issues. A non functioning tag light was a common offense that would cost the driver $110. Those who couldn’t immediately pay the fine in cash were scheduled to return every other week to pay $20- $25 at some time specified by the clerk. Of course it the ‘scofflaws’ work scheduled conflicted with the court’s schedule the “lazy, irresponsible” outlaw became a criminal charged with the crime of contempt of court if he didn’t show up but would likely be fired if he missed work or was late due to court…\nFWIW a few weeks ago I was leaving town and realized I didn’t have my wallet and unbuckled my seat belt at traffic light to see if it had fallen out of my pocket. The light changed and I drove on to a convenient side street where I turned to look for the wallet before continuing. As soon as I turned I recognized the blue light behind me and pulled over. The officer immediately told me I should have had my seat belt buckled and when I explained what the situation was and that I had apparently left home without my wallet he advised me to immediately get it and make it a point to keep the belt buckled then went to his car and drove away. I was amazed and drove  home to get the wallet and realized I had put a bumper sticker on my truck. It was then I realized the Viet Nam Veterans ribbon decal with the Eagle Globe and Anchor was on my rear bumper and I honestly can’t think of any other reason I was not cited. It’s obvious that traffic officers have a great deal of discretion and in my case I am grateful. But there are many whose past is equal or superior in merit to mine but without being somewhat universally recognized in a bumper sticker. Maybe the officer’s father was a Viet Nam veteran or possibly even his grandfather. Damn I’m getting old.', '\n\n\n FoDaddy:\n\nBut I that wealthier person may have made better choices in life than the poorer person did, and shouldn’t be penalized for it.\n\n\nYou mean like Daddy giving you $400 million?\nAll traffic laws are State…NOT federal. So each state would have to impose their own type of fairness.\nAnd I think most traffic laws and enforcement will be moot when driverless vehicles become the norm.', 'I have to agree with the article to some extent. In a neighboring small city I was stopped 3 times in 3 consecutive trips through there for “speeding” even though I was very careful to drive close to 5 under. In court the cop didn’t even show up and the judge found me guilty anyway. And to quote the judge; “Well, so and so is getting kind of old and he probably didn’t like your looks. Matter of fact I don’t even like your looks (long hair/beard) so you’re guilty and learn to respect the law”.\nA local wealthy real estate agent who drives a Rolls freely admitted to a newspaper reporter that he drives foot on the floor all of the time. He has been ticketed countless times by the police including 40 over in an active school zone.\nHis response was that he was not going to quit and he had no intention of paying any ticket. It was also revealed that he never showed up to pay or contest a single one of those tickets. The citations would go before a judge in court who would automatically dismiss them even with the cops present and no sign of the defendant. It was also revealed the judge’s law firm handled some real estate transactions. No conflict there…']",112,2.0k

68,A close call for a classic car,Safety,[],keith,"['ok4450', 'Whitey', 'VDCdriver']","Earlier today, I had the misfortune to be in a line of traffic following a tree service truck onto I-287.
At the beginning of the ramp, the truck was doing only 20 mph, but I assumed that the driver would have the sense to accelerate to something close to highway speed when he got closer to the merge.  Unfortunately, he decided to maintain 20 mph at the merge, even though the truck was lightly-loaded.
Obviously, everyone in the conga line in back of the truck was checking his side-view mirror for a safe chance to pull into the center lane in order to get past this rolling hazard, but because of a steady flow of traffic, we were all essentially trapped in back of that damn truck.   However, that didn’t stop the guy in back of me from veering into the center lane, directly into the path of a beautiful '56 T-bird that was cruising at or above the road’s 65 mph limit.
Clearly, a '56 T-bird lacks the braking power or the handling ability of a modern car, but–somehow–the driver of that classic was able to avoid hitting the a-hole who veered directly into his path.
Kudos to the driver of that beautiful red T-bird for being able to avoid that collision!

On an interstate drive, mostly level during snowy weather, is AWD substantially safer?
Specifically, the main threat is spinouts. Real bad with RWD but that is not in this discussion.","['No. AWD is handy for getting started from a dead stop when it’s slippery. Once you’re moving, AWD cannot defy the laws of physics by allowing you to stop faster than you could with FWD.\nPsychologically speaking, AWD is often more dangerous, because people with AWD think they’re invincible and drive like idiots when it’s snowing.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nAWD is handy for getting started from a dead stop when it’s slippery. Once you’re moving, AWD cannot defy the laws of physics by allowing you to stop faster than you could with FWD.\n\n\nNo, AWD can’t help you to stop in a shorter distance than FWD can, but when you come to a curve in the road, AWD gives one a substantial advantage over FWD.    My approach is to equip my AWD vehicles with winter tires.  As long as someone with AWD and winter tires drives in a sane manner, he she should be able to navigate in extreme winter weather without any problems, and that can’t be said for either FWD or 4WD.\nIn my experience, the vehicles that wind up spun-out and stranded in the median of a highway are those with 4WD–usually, but not exclusively Jeeps–whose drivers didn’t understand the significant limitations of 4WD–as opposed to AWD.', '\n\n\n melott:\n\nSpecifically, the main threat is spinouts.\n\n\nFront weight biased cars naturally want to understeer. Understeer is when you need to turn the steering wheel more to negotiate the turn. This doesn’t matter if you have AWD or FWD. It only matters with RWD because the power goes to the rear wheels and overcome the rear wheel’s ability to grab the road. Add enough power and you spin. Rear heavy cars, like a Porsche 911, naturally tend to oversteer, or spin the rear out. Add a little power and they REALLY want to spin out.\nCars like Audi Quattro and Subaru AWD cars are essentially FWD cars with a transfer case and rear differential. The FWD versions of these cars, if they overcome traction at the front wheels just slide wide of the direction of travel, or understeer very badly.  Adding AWD to those cars spreads the power to all 4 wheels so they don’t break traction so easily but they still ultimately understeer.\nIs AWD safer? The handling is easier to control by a less-than-talented (heavy footed) driver. They don’t get stuck as easily in slippery stuff. Do they stop faster? NO. The same 4 tires are used to stop the vehicle FWD or AWD.\nYou want safer? Buy winter wheels and tires for any car used on snow and ice.', 'I don’t like the top heavy feeling in sweeping curves with my awd equinox. I think once the front tires start to slip than the power transfer to rear does not really help as you sweep thru a curve. Would a lower CG sedan do better? Or maybe an awd sedan?', '\n\n\n Cavell:\n\nWould a lower CG sedan do better?\n\n\nAlways will be better. Lower center of gravity vehicles don’t transfer as much weight from the inside tire to the outside tire in a turn. The more weight on the tire during turning, the less the ability of the tire to generate the lateral force needed to keep the car on the road.', ""\n\n\n Mustangman:\n\nCars like Audi Quattro and Subaru AWD cars are essentially FWD cars with a transfer case and rear differential.

Biggest impact was using winter tires.  FWD did fine.', '\n\n\n VDCdriver:\n\nbut when you come to a curve in the road, AWD gives one a substantial advantage over FWD.\n\n\nI would argue that if you need that advantage on a curve, you are going to fast to stop properly should you suddenly need to.\nIn other words, AWD is nice for getting started, but you should not consider it to be an advantage for any other phase of driving, because that leads to overconfidence.\n\n\n\n VDCdriver:\n\n… that may well be true, but I have been able to drive for the past 23 years in winter conditions without any spin-outs–or even getting stuck–once I switched to AWD Subarus equipped with winter tires.\n\n\nI’d be willing to bet you were decently safe before then, too, because you don’t strike me as a lunatic driver.\nThe number of Subarus around here that drive like morons when the highway is covered with snow is staggering.

BIG difference.\nI don’t agree with Utah dropping the BAC to 0.05. Especially in light of studies that say there would be no net affect on traffic deaths. The practical matter is that it means a 140 lb person having 2 drinks at dinner over the course of an hour is barely under the legal limit. Since BAC varies quite a bit with metabolism and such, that second drink is best avoided. The 0.08 limit would allow a 100 lb person 2 drinks at dinner with some lee-way before reaching the limit.', 'During my lifetime, I have lost several friends to drunk drivers.  Not one of the drunk drivers had a BAC of .08 or even .10.  The lowest was .16 and the highest was .24.

And just recently the city’s prosecuting attorney was charged with refusal to take a breathalizer  test at a road block but was taken home.\nAs far as the blood alcohol level though, I personally agree that the law should err on the side of safety.

Records are now kept at state level.\nOther states may still have this issue of keeping records at the county level.  You may want to check your state.

Dropping to 0.05 creates a whole new class of criminals, with no clear benefit.\n\n\nEspecially when you factor in the laws in many states surrounding “care, custody, and control,” which state that if you are in control of the vehicle, or could be in control of it, you are drunk driving. What this has shaken out to mean is that if you are drunk, sleeping it off in the back seat of your car with the keys anywhere inside the car, you get a DWI. Or if you’re drunk, and standing next to your car with your keys in your pocket, you get a DWI.\nThere was a case in my state where a guy got drunk in his apartment, then wanted to grab something from his car. So he went down to the parking lot and fell into a drunken sleep in his car. A neighbor thought he was in distress and called the cops. The cops got there, felt the hood and determined the car had not been driven at all, and said as much in the charging documents accusing him of drunk driving. He was convicted.\nMeanwhile as @Mustangman said, people who are actually drunk and actually driving are allowed to continue to get drunk and drive because until you get a very high number of DWIs, you don’t even go to jail.\nThe DWI laws in this country are largely insane.', 'I expect there to be diminishing returns for this, just like everything else, but in the case of drunk driving, it doesn’t happen in a controlled environment, and this article suggests enforcement could be the reason: ""One plausible explanation is that the legislative change was not suitably enforced…""\nWith that in mind, if you enjoy drinking so much that you can’t wait until you get home to do it, or arrange for a designated driver (like a friend, a taxi, an Uber, or a Lyft), maybe you have a drinking problem.  The same goes if you can’t enjoy a social event without drinking.\nI’ve said this to cigarette smokers for decades, but it goes for drinkers too: Can’t you wait until you get home to get your fix, like the rest of the world’s functioning addicts?', '\n\n\n Whitey:\n\nCan’t you wait until you get home to get your fix, like the rest of the world’s functioning addicts?\n\n\nWell, no, because I have not spent a decade plus learning how to build interesting drinks.\nPut another way, why can’t you wait to get home before you eat, instead of eating at a restaurant? Because the chef is better than you are at cooking. And the bartender is better than I am at bartending.\nI think it’s incredibly inappropriate to imply that everyone who drinks outside of their house has an alcohol addiction.\nThe issue with .05 vs .08 has nothing to do with alcoholism or impaired driving, because at .08 most people are not impaired to a level that impacts driving safety. And its important to add that last, because at .001 BAC you are “impaired,” which is how MADD and the other over-the-top advocacy groups get away with claiming “impairment” at .08 and .05.\nWell, look. I’m impaired every time I drive because I’m nearsighted, which means I wear glasses. Something happens outside the frame of my glasses, I won’t see it as clearly as the lucky jerk with perfect vision. If there’s a fingerprint smudge on my lens, I’m impaired.\nThe question is whether or not that impairment impacts traffic safety, and it does not. Neither does having one or two drinks max with dinner.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nWell, no, because I have not spent a decade plus learning how to build interesting drinks.\n\n\nIf you can follow a drink recipe, it doesn’t take a decade to learn how to make a drink.\n\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nI think it’s incredibly inappropriate to imply that everyone who drinks outside of their house has an alcohol addiction.\n\n\nI think it’s beneath you to engage in a straw man argument by misrepresenting my position.  It’s not those who choose to drink outside the home who have a problem, it’s those who are unable to wait to drink until they can get their alcohol fix without putting others in danger who have a problem.\nIf you make arrangements for safe sober transportation, I don’t care where you drink or how much you drink.  If you insist on endangering others because you’re unable to follow a drink recipe, well, let’s just say I’m sure you’re smart enough to follow a recipe.']",23,1.2k

In doing an internet search, I found a post on a forum of someone towing a 7,000 lb airstream trailer with an odyssey, promptly followed by a slew of posts saying s/he was crazy, an idiot, will likely die on his next trip and go to hell, etc.
All this got me thinking - When I was growing up our neighbors had an airstream trailer that they towed with their 1978 Ford LTD. Now I don’t know the specifics of the trailer, but I’m guessing it on the order of 5-7000 lbs. Now, comparing the LTD with our Odyssey:
1978 Ford LTD
Engine: 5 L V8, 134 HP, 248 lb-ft torque
3 speed automatic transmission
4222 lbs
4 wheel 300mm disc brakes
Towing capacity: ???
2011 Honda Odyssey
Engine: 3.5L V6, 248 HP, 250 lb-ft torque
5 speed automatic transmission
4337 lbs
4 wheel, 320 mm disc brakes
Rated towing capacity: 3500 lbs.
I don’t have the details on the suspensions, but I’d wager that the Odyssey has a better suspension system than the LTD.
So the question I have is where does the 3500 lb rated capacity come from, is it necessarily unsafe to tow a larger load, and if so, how do you reconcile that with the fact that a vehicle that was arguably inferior in every aspect could tow something nearly twice as heavy? (for the sake of argument, assume that the odyssey has a proper hitch and transmission cooling, etc)","['The LTD was rear-wheel drive and presumably had body-on-frame construction.

About 6:45AM. I was making the 15 mile journey to sit my Grandson in the capitol city. Clear sky, dry pavement. and light traffic. Perfect. I was on the bridge with no conflicting traffic and slowing to take my left exit to a surface street with no one behind me. I heard a screaming engine and saw a giant pickup at a high rate of speed approaching in the lane to my right. I thought “no their not” then realized “yes they are” swerve into my lane, slam on their brakes and take the exit which is a downhill sharp left hand blind curve which frequently has several vehicles stopped for a traffic signal at the bottom. There was only a couple vehicles at the light and he stopped in time. I usually only use my horn as a warning but this A-hole deserved it. Unfortunately my Kia’s horn is about as intimidating as a Plymouth Roadrunners ‘Beep-Beep’. The A-hole in his side view mirror was laughing at me while giving me the finger!
Number 2
While driving home everything was again fine,  I was cruising on the four lane and noticed a California car trapped behind a slow heavy tractor trailer. I slowed and let them into the left lane. They took forever to pass the truck. and continued at a very slow 50mph speed in the left lane. When I attempted to pass in the right lane they of course accelerated. I am unfortunately familiar with this game and choose not to play. I resumed following them as they returned to their less than 50mph rolling road block speed while everyone else including the truck! Passed on the right. I turned left onto the 2 lane highway and continued home being very thankful to be rid of them.
Number 3
The next morning I was driving on an extra wide 25mph residential street. A pickup driver ran the stop sign from a side street on my left then continued in front of me at 15mph! As they approached a car parked at the curb they moved to the oncoming lane barely missing it by 10 FEET! The street ends with a 90 degree left hand blind curve. There was another parked car and they again moved to the oncoming lane through the blind curve!

A few miles later on a local busy 4-lane road a driver impatient to make a left turn, not willing to wait far back in backed up traffic, simply pulled into lighter oncoming traffic racing wrong way at high speed forcing oncoming cars, including me, dodge out of the way as best we could.  Nearer to home I barely missed a third almost head-on by a gal in a huge SUV so busy apparently texting she blew through a red light and drifted into oncoming traffic.  Lots of drivers blowing horns at her barely got her attention long enough to steer back into her own lane before the phone was back up in her face with both hands on the phone!

A dump truck and a school bus filled with 5th graders on a field trip collided, and it resulted in the death of one child and one teacher.
While it will take a while for the State Police to determine who was at fault, the one thing that is clear is that the construction of that school bus was incredibly deficient, because when the school bus impacted a guard rail, the entire body of the bus separated from the vehicle’s frame.
Is this typical of how school buses are built by the companies that assemble them?

N.J. school bus accident: Paramus student, teacher killed in field trip crash 1
A fifth grader and a teacher from Paramus were killed Thursday morning when a school bus and dump truck collided on Route 80, Gov. Phil Murphy said.





","['I’ve never heard of this happening.\nMy first reaction is that there’s something wrong with the design, but without knowing a whole lot more it’s impossible to say. I also have no idea how a schoolbus is constructed, or even if there’s a standard design or different manufacturers use different designs.\nThe Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) regulates all Over-The-Road vehicles. When I worked for a company designing and making tank trucks, we had numerous requirements we had to meet, and numerous tests we needed to perform. Every truck needed to be certified for compliance. I have to believe schoolbusses have the same. Of course, knowing how our regulatory systems work, they’re probably exempt!\nI just plain don’t know enough about it. But it needs to be thoroughly investigated both for cause and  for design. Our kids deserve better than this.', 'I was a trucker for 40 years and a school bus driver for 15.  School Bus Construction is MORE closely regulated than truck construction. They have to meet federal and state requirements and in NY are inspected twice yearly by state inspectors.  That the body of the bus survived more or less intact in a crash so violent as to tear it from the frame and a very large majority of the people onboard lived is a testament to the strength of the body.\nPreliminary reports are indicating the the driver missed his or her exit and was making an illegal U-turn on an expressway.\nI would be more focused on that as what needs to be addressed, rather than the construction of the bus.\nThere is a huge shortage if school bus drivers in this country and a big push by school districts to save money by turning to for profit companies to save money and avoid hiring and training their own drivers.  The savings are short term, once you get rid of your fleet, the for profit companies hike their rates.\nThe shortage is caused by almost all the jobs being part time, have much unpaid training to qualify for, have huge legal responsibility, and don’t pay all that well.\nOur state legislators have made the bus driver legally responsible for the reasonable behavior of the students. One our drivers was driving a bunch of delinquents on a field trip to a state park.  When I say delinquents, I am talking about students that have been kicked out of regular classes and off the regular school buses. On the way back to school these kids mugged one of their classmates and threw his jacket out the window  on the I-290 causing a driver in a car to swerve and crash.  Even though the teacher and his aide were on the bus, the driver was issued a ticket for failing to control the students while she was driving 55 mph.\nPart of the problem could be solved by making these jobs full time with benefits by using the drivers in the time in between runs as building and grounds, or cafeteria workers.\nWgen there is a big shortage of workers you wind up employing so,e people you shouldn’t.', '\n\n\n oldtimer_11:\n\nPreliminary reports are indicating the the driver missed his or her exit and was making an illegal U-turn on an expressway.\n\n\nThat has been confirmed by multiple witnesses.   The fact that the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office is involved in the investigation is probably not a good thing for the bus driver, because under NJ law, he could be tried for manslaughter.\n', 'That the body separated from the frame may be more a function of the bus hitting the end of the guard rail head on than poor design or construction.', 'Really hard to say if there’s a defect in the bus. It could even be possible that the separation saved lives because some of the energy of the crash went into ripping the body off of the chassis rather than going into the kids.\nAt any rate, school buses can only be made so safe. It’s pretty hard to achieve 100% survivability against being slammed into by a dump truck which appears to have been carrying a load. We’re talking tens of thousands of pounds slamming into an almost stationary object if the U-turn allegation is true.\nThat the bus protected its occupants well enough so only 2 people died is actually pretty amazing.', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nThat the bus protected its occupants well enough so only 2 people died is actually pretty amazing.\n\n\nThat is probably due–at least in part–to NJ’s regulation that all school buses must be equipped with lap belts, and that students wear those belts.', 'From the internet:\nFederal law requires smaller school buses – those weighing 10,000 pounds or less – to have lap-shoulder belts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. School buses above that weight are not mandated to provide seat belts for passengers.\nStates or local jurisdictions, however, are free to pass stricter regulations.\nSeven states – Arkansas, California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York and Texas – have passed some variation of a seat belt law for larger school buses (even if funding had not been appropriated in all cases), notes the National Conference of State Legislatures.', 'I believe, per passenger mile, school buses are one of the safest vehicles on the road.  I don’t know much about today’s buses, but the school buses I rode in the late 1940s through the mid 1950s were on truck chassis.  In the rural school I attended, the driver owned the bus and bid on the route with the school district.  Often, when a bus was removed from service due to age, the body was removed from the chassis, a cab was purchased from a wrecking yard and installed along with a grain bed.  The body that was removed became a chicken coop or a tool shed.  I remember buses at our school on Chevrolet, Ford, International, GMC and Studebaker truck chassis with bodies made by Wayne, Superior, Carpenter and Hicks.  I am sure that has changed today.\nI also remember in the early 1950s that turning signals and stop lights had to be installed on buses.  Up to that point, the only signal was a lone, unlit stop arm on the left side of the bus. The buses I rode had vacuum wipers and no power assist on either the brakes or steering. However, we didn’t have any accidents in my district.\nI don’t think it is the modern school buses that are unsafe.  It is the drivers and the lack of discipline of the children riding the buses.', 'Well as usual the real question is why there are so many buses now?  I think it all started some 20-30 years ago from a court ruling that required busing kids all over town so there was a proper mix of skin colors.  Then I think it grew so that everyone now gets a ride to and from school.  I’m amazed at our local school busing budget and I watch kids getting rides that are only a mile away from school.  In the old days it was only the kids that lived in the rural areas that got a ride on a bus.  So at any rate demand went up and the quality of the drivers went down accordingly.\nMan i’ll do anything to get out of waxing the cars.  Gotta go.', 'And in the old days, you lived on average at least 10 years less, in poorer health, with fewer modern amenities, driving cars that couldn’t even get to 100,000 miles without needing replacement and which were equipped with spears for steering columns that were just waiting to skewer you through the heart if you got into a wreck.\nYou had your school day interrupted by drilling for The Bomb (drills that taught techniques that would do precisely squat to enhance your survivability), your mom was a pariah if she tried to get a job - especially one that wasn’t “woman’s work,”  and by the way if you had the “wrong” skin color then people with the “right” skin color made your life hell.\nOh, and gasoline was laced with lead, the side of the road was laced with DDT, and every time you hit the brakes you spewed asbestos into the air.\nI’m all for modernity. The rose-tinted nostalgia for the considerably-worse past is nothing but fantasy.', 'The reason there are so many buses is that we are much more risk averse than we were 60 years ago. My kids were in grade school 20 years ago, and the number of buses was the same as today. You have to go back much farther. If a child has to cross a busy road, they get a bus. It used to be that there were one or two bus stop per neighborhood, but today, there are many more. It seems that school buses stop at each street corner rather than have the kids walk 50 feet to the next intersection. When I was in high school, I had to walk 0.9 miles to school along a busy road without a sidewalk. It didn’t bother me, but that would never happen today. There would be a bus because of the busy road.', '\n\n\n Bing:\n\n. In the old days it was only the kids that lived in the rural areas that got a ride on a bus. So at any rate demand went up and the quality of the drivers went down accordingly.\n\n\nToday, at least in my area, there is a demand that the buses pick up kids in font of their houses, even if the houses are maybe 50-75 yards away from each other…in subdivisions, not busy streets by any means.', 'There are also far more people in the country today. A huge increase in the population necessitates a huge increase in the busses.', 'I am not certain how much has changed from the good old days.  When I rode the school bus in the late 1940s through them mid 1950s, we stopped at every house no matter how close together the houses. There was an addition of houses and we y stopped at every house.  There was a kid that lived 100 yards from the school and he had to ride the bus.\nWhat has changed in my area is school closing because of bad weather.  Our country school didn’t close.  Our bus got stuck just after picking up a high school girl.  She was about 5’ 3"" tall and  may have weighed 100 pounds.  She calmly got off the bus, got her Dad’s Farmall tractor out of the barn, hooked on to the front of the bus and pulled the bus free.  We waited while she put the tractor back in the barn and proceeded to school. I also remember coming home from school and one kid on the bus spotted a Texas Longhorn in a pasture.  Nobody in East Central Indiana had a Longhorn.  Our beef cattle were Herefords.  The driver immediately stopped the bus and we all got out to look at the Longhorn.  This was a big event.', 'If you don’t like school buses you’l love California.  I haven’t seen a regular school bus in years.  There are the short buses for the handicapped kids, but in the wealthy San Francisco suburbs there are none that I see for regular kids.  The traffic jams around suburban schools every morning and afternoon are incredible, and the driving by parents is beyond belief.', '@Triedaq I’ll bet she has been a great wife.', ""The latest update on that tragic school bus accident reveals that the bus driver is 77 years old, and that he has a long record of driving violations.   The violations apparently occurred before he began driving a school bus, but–of course–that leads to the question of how carefully the school district vetted his driving record.\nThe most shocking part of the update is that his attempted illegal U-turn on I-80 involved driving in a perpendicular fashion, directly from a right-lane entry ramp,  across 3 lanes of high speed traffic.\n\n\nNJ.com\n\n\n\nHe was 77 and driving a school bus in a fatal crash. Too old? Here are N.J.'s...\nThe driver in the fatal school bus crash on I-80 in Mt. Olive was 77 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n"", '\n\n\n jtsanders:\n\nThe reason there are so many buses is that we are much more risk averse than we were 60 years ago.\n\n\nI think that’s part of it…but I also think there actually IS more risk. There are now 5 times as many cars on the road that can go much faster (and they do). Road safety for pedestrians hasn’t improved that much during that time. My school district was one of the last to start bussing. There was no increase in busses, or kids bussed in our school district. Different routes.', 'I think the article is asking the wrong question. The problem here isn’t that the guy is old, it’s that he’s an idiot and has been for decades, seeing as the first of his 14 license suspensions was in 1975. In fairness, most of those suspensions were non-driving related (though the last one listed, which was for driving on a suspended license, points to the idea that this guy just doesn’t give a hoot about rules), but that said, I’m willing to bet none of us here have had our license suspended even once, for any reason, much less 14 times.']",36,3.0k

I mean, by that logic the fact that I own a chef’s knife means I can potentially kill my neighbor, so I should therefore be in prison.\nOn the other hand, other DUI laws are entirely too lax. There are a lot of people driving around out there with double-digit DUI convictions on their records. Why? You should face very heavy penalties after the first one, lose your license after the second one, and be imprisoned if you’re caught driving again before you get the license back, drunk or not.\nAs far as pre-drive breathalyzers, I think it’s a lot closer to my first point than my second.

If acquitted, the car should be returned without charge. If convicted, the car should be confiscated… whether it’s theirs or not. Nobody is going to loan their buddy, or son, or daughter their car if that person has already had a car confiscated for DUI. Thus, in most cases, that would remove the ability of a DUI to repeat by removing the car from the equation. Other penalties should also be stricter, but removing the car is the big one IMHO.\nYes, I know that the car’s owner would still be responsible for paying the loan. Tough.

If the owner knows that the person driving the vehicle is prone to drunk driving, I agree completely, but if the owner has said to the driver that, in order to drive my car, You have to follow the law. Period. No speeding, no drinking, no dangerous driving etc and the person driving the is NOT known to be a “bad person”, I find it hard to punish the owner that hard.

But then back when I was a TV geek I did some stories on drunk driving issues. Turns out some people drive legally drunk, and they have no idea that they’re impaired. Most people wouldn’t think twice about driving after having 2 drinks over 4 hours on an evening out, but some people are actually impaired if they do that.\nSo, the first one isn’t free, but it isn’t “you’re going to get fired because you can’t get to work anymore” just to allow those who simply need to be educated that what they thought was sober driving isn’t to learn their lesson and move on.\nI don’t advocate punishing people harshly when they do not realize they are committing a crime and have every intention not to commit that crime.

You should be asking your state Department of Motor Vehicles.\nBut if your state has no objection, I think it’s a fine idea, provided you have the knowledge to create a resulting structure with mechanical integrity. Box trucks are created as a full-frame chassis that will accept a variety of cabs and beds. They’re not unibody. The box is not part of the chassis. While strolling though truck sales lots I’ve seen rows of various truck chassis without boxes or beds just waiting for their chosen cargo or construction addition. Some become box trucks, some become stakebeds, some become campers, some become dump trucks, some even become the bucket trucks used by power companies. Companies specialize in creating these beds and systems for truck chassis. Toyota even used to sell truck chassis in the U.S… You may have seen some with campers on them.\nIn short, GM, Ford, Chevy, Dodge, and other vehicle manufacturers don’t make box trucks. They make truck chassis. Other specialty companies make the boxes and other application-specific aft-bodies and mount them on the appropriate chassis.\nFor the record, I worked for a company that made tanks and pump systems for specific chassis.

As an adult with a fair paying job, it is now my goal to own one of these.  I owe it to myself for more than 25 years spent day dreaming about that ride.
So the practical part of my brain kicks in and cautions me about ‘vehicle safety’.  How safe are the older Mustangs to drive?  Yes it’s a beautiful hunk of steal which would likely peal through the composite materials of today’s cars.  But how safe are the older Mustangs for passenger and driver in an accident that’s more than a fender bender?  The internet revealed few insights so far, other than a CBS quote-unquote article from 1999 about how much of a death trap the drop in fuel tank is (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mustang-a-classic-danger/ 134).  But that article is a million years old and we don’t exactly hear about how everyone driving a classic Mustang dies a fiery death.
I’m looking for practical opinions on the safety issues for the classic Mustangs.  Ultimately I want to make a safe decision when I get around to purchasing one of these guys.","['Compared to even the least safe cars of today, the 60s Mustang and any other 60s cars are very unsafe. True, by the late 60s we had seat belts, and some crash padding on the dash as well as better doors with a protective bar inside.\nThe standard tires on the Mustang were very inadequate, the brakes marginal and the whole body structure, especially with some rust, not very sturdy.\nEnthusiast who have thsese cars drive them very little, so your chance of an accicdent is very small. I would not recommend these cars as daily drivers, however.', 'The mechanics are quite basic and relatively simple to maintain and repair and if driven within its limits the car is relatively safe. The greatest problem to overcome seems to be rust. Those floor pans were prone to rust and sag. An Arizona car might remain solid but I pass a scrap yard full of old Mustangs often. The older models have the floorboards resting on the ground even when the wheels are on them.', ""As stated, a 60’s Mustang will not be as safe as a new one. The 60’s 'Stangs did not have crumple zones, collapsible bumper brackets, shoulder straps, and even collapsible sterring columns. NTSB released a video of a 60’s Impala having an offset head-on crash with a modern Impala. It’s on Youtube. The driver of the modern car walked away with minor injuries, but the othrr driver died on impact. I’m not trying to scare you off, but just to know reality. I have a '62 Thunderbird I’m restoring, but plan on using it on nice, clear weekends just for fun. Not as a daily driver."", 'Here’s an option…albeit expensive.\n\n\n\nMotor Authority\n\n\n\nBuild A Brand-New 1965 Mustang Convertible With A Ford-Approved Body Shell 149\nIt’s now possible to build a brand new ’64½, ’65 or ’66 Ford Mustang convertible from the wheels up using this latest Ford-approved and officially licensed body shell. Unveiled today ahead of its public debut at next...\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Having owned a 65 Mustang I can say they had poor body integrity, even for their time. In comparison my 72 Duster was built like a tank. As for fire danger, it’s very real. In addition to the top of the fuel tank serving as the floor of the trunk, the bigger danger was the flexible rubber hose connecting the tank to the filler on the back of the car. In a rear end crash that hose would fail, spewing gas into the trunk, where broken wires would spark and ignite the gas. The fire would quickly spread to the passenger compartment because the rear seat back was the only separation between the trunk and the passengers (no metal bulkhead).\nHow much driving do you want to do?  As a hobby car I wouldn’t mind, but I wouldn’t put many miles on one.  When I think about buying an old one, I remind myself that new Mustangs are WAY better in every way.  Almost bought one, maybe one day…', 'Ugh  - Equal parts educational and disheartening.\nHonestly I was looking to purchase a classic Mustang as my primary vehicle.  Having one tricked out and cherry sitting in my garage or weekend drives around town just wouldn’t be the same level of joy as driving around everywhere in it; whether it was cherry or not.  A friend of mine has an Aston Martin but he barely drives it so he’s thinking of selling it; that’s the feeling I want to avoid.\nMy driving skills are fantastic, but I can only compensate so much for horrible road conditions and crappy drivers. \nEverything I’ve heard so far really seems to steer away from having a classic Mustang as a primary vehicle.  I’m still hoping to come across something that (also financially practical) which suggests a way around what may be the inevitable: buy one and don’t drive it much.\nI did find a <a href=""http://www.mustangandfords.com/featured-vehicles/mump-0508-classic-ford-mustang-guide/>decent article with several safety improvements.  But I can only guess it may effectively double however much I were to spend on the car to make the improvements (since I really have super minimal car experience, let alone equipment), not to mention the article doesn’t touch on the gas tank.', ""My brother got a new '65 Mustang and I got a new '67 Mustang.  Both had 289 V8’s and 3 spd manual transmissions.  Compared to current cars they are very unsafe.\nMy '67 had drum brakes all around and did not have power brakes.  Braking was fine in dry conditions but did take a lot of foot pressure.  Since no new drivers since the 70’s have never experienced non-power brakes you will find the pressure needed to stop the car to be excessive.  And stopping distances very long.\nWhen the drum brakes got wet, as in after going through a puddle on the road then you have virtually no brakes until they dried out.  Drying out the brakes is also something no new driver has ever done.  In effect, you apply brake pressure with the left foot while maintaining speed with the right foot on the gas until you feel the brakes starting to work again.  It can take 2/10ths of a mile or so for the brakes start to work again - not safe.\nThe unibody was pretty skimpy by current standards so a vintage Mustang hit from the side will not do much to protect the driver or other occupants.  The gas tank is just under the trunk and does not do well in rear end collisions.  It wasn’t as bad as the Pinto, but not that much better either.\nThe front and rear bumpers are completely useless.  They give no protection at all.  A very slow speed bump will dent sheet metal and prove to be an expensive repair.  Parking lot impacts that do no visible damage to a modern car would do a bunch of damage to a vintage Mustang.  I’d park it far from other vehicles if you go to the grocery store or local mall.\nNow handling, good for the era but like an untamed beast by modern standards.  My '67 came with Wide Oval Firestone tires.  They were awful, hydroplaned at 30 mph, and were worn out in less than 12K miles.  I found some Dunlop radials in the wide oval size and they were much better.  Even with the Dunlops the back end of the car would hop wickedly to the side when taking a hard turn on uneven pavement.  In a modern car the reviewer would call it unacceptable.  Back in the day most lighter weight rear wheel cars with V8 power did the same thing, but the Mustang was really bad in this regard.  How your vintage Mustang handles will depend on the tires you run on it, very good shocks, pretty hefty springs, and still it will just plain hop around on rough pavement no matter what you do.\nThe cars were and still would be fun to drive, but they are simply unsafe compared to even the poorest scoring current model cars.  I haven’t driven a new version Mustang, but I’d bet that a V6 Mustang with a manual transmission would be a hoot to drive and not far off the performance of my '67.  A V8 would out perform my '67 on all fronts.  If you are looking for a daily driver, test drive a NEW Camaro, Mustang, or Charger and you’ll save money and have fun.\nIf you just want a vintage Mustang as a hobby car, to take to shows and for nice weekend drives go for a well restored one.  Just make sure it has a V8 and manual transmission if possible.  The original 6 in a vintage Mustang is just a dog and not fun to drive at all, looks great but no guts.  The auto transmission a vintage Mustang is the same auto tranny used on most Fords of the day.  It was a 3 speed unit with a floor shift set up.  D, 2, and L gave you some opportunity to select the gear but it was a pretty sloppy shift and just not nearly as fun and connected feeling as a 3 or 4 speed manual.  The power loss was notable in the auto tranny since the torque converter was very inefficient by modern standards."", 'The dream may exceed the reality. Great to look at, they were nothing special to drive.  Based on the Falcon, they were no  ‘sports car’ as far as handling.', 'You can get a new Mustang for far less than a cherry 1960s Mustang.  You can get a reasonably well appointed 6cylinder for less than $24,000.  Even a GT coupe is a little over $30,000, and that’s about where you would start for any 1960s Mustang V8.  The new ones still look good, are safe to drive, and even get better gas mileage.', '@jtsanders, I can second that! Being the owner of a 2007 GT V8, I can attest that it gives all the fun of the original and better safety, mileage and handling. You can buy used S197 (2005 up) Mustangs in the mid-teens with 240 hp V6 or a 300 hp small V8. Either will get over 24 mpg on the highway and have dual airbags. Step up to a 2011 model and the V6 is 305 hp, gets 26-28 mpg on the highway. No need for the V8 to have fun.', 'Thanks for all the tips everyone, and thanks for the detailed spiel @UncleTurbo\u200c, and @Mustanman\u200c’s person account.  I have no desire to run the risk of incinerating my back seat passengers, among other safety issues.  I’ll probably slate the vintage model for a future project car or a weekend cruiser.  For now I think I’ll shift my research into a late 00’s or preteen Mustang and get as much of the vintage throwback body as I can, with the perks of a safer car.\nIs there anything significantly different between, say, a 2006 and 2013?  GT vs. non?', 'How willing are you to modernize various aspects of the early Mustang chassis while still keeping its exterior appearance reasonably close to original?  How able?  It may not be possible to add air bags, but it is possible to improve passenger cell integrity, install a collapsible steering column, and duplicate the crumple zone approach to dissipate crash energy.  Easier still to upgrade the wheel, tire, and brake package and the suspension to bring its driving and handling up closer to current standards.  You might have a bit more difficulty with side-impact bars, but you could still end up with a better situation than none at all if you go through a company experienced in fabricating racing car roll cages.\nEFI and overdrive transmissions can work nearly as well from an aftermarket direction for driveability and fuel consumption as they do for the OE’s, at least up to within only a few years ago.\nTake a look over at www.protouring.com 59 or www.lateral-g.net 36 to see what some have done to bring various 1960’s cars into the 21st century.  P.S., you don’t have to spend nearly as much money as some have.\nNorm', 'There are times I wished I had kept the 1968 Javelin that I once owned. The Javelin was the AMC answer to the Ford Mustang.  My Javelin did have the shoulder harness as well as a collapsible steering column.  However, it still used drum brakes all around.  I liked the styling better than either the Mustang or Camaro.  I purchased my Javelin used and got a good price because it had a 6 cylinder engine.\nI traded the Javelin because it was not a good family car after we had a baby.  The rear seat was too cramped to take people with us and the size of the trunk was only suitable for a mouse on a field trip.  The AMC 232 six in that Javelin was a reliable engine, however.', 'In addition to the trunk/gas tank issue the early mustangs didn’t come with head restraints. Our friend’s wife broke her neck when the car was rear ended and she was taken off life support a couple days after the accident. It’s been 20+ years and he still wishes he had just sold the car when she asked him to.', 'I attended a classic air-cooled VW show last weekend here in San Jose.  Owner’s brought their   VW’s from the late 1940’s (where the turn signal is a sort of lighted stick that pokes out of the door pillar when you want to make a turn) to about 1975 when US air-cooled VW’s stopped being manufactured.  It was nothing but VW enthusiasts.  Almost all of the vehicles were driven to the show.  Some from hundreds of miles away.  And most everyone there seemed to be having a great time.\nSo classic cars,  it’s a compromise.  They aren’t as safe.  But they can be a lot of fun.  I’d say if this is something you like, willing to take on some risk, then take some common sense safety precautions where you can, keep the car well maintained, pay up your life insurance, buy one and enjoy your new drive.\nIf I were doing this – and I do plan to, but with a VW Beetle, not a Mustang – but I were buying a Mustang I’d only consider a 1964 1/2 or a 1965.  Those were the only models in my opinion that had the true “looks-like-it-is-moving-standing-still” Mustang look.', '@Chrisopolis, the new retro body started in 2005 with a 300 hp V8 in the GT and a 240 hp V6 in the base. The 2011 model gets a new 305 hp direct injection V6 as the base motor (much nicer, smoother, more power). The 2005 to 2014 cars have a solid rear axle but it handles much better than the 2004 and earlier cars. I’d go with a V8 in pre 2011 cars and the V6 in post 2011 cars. Otherwise the cars are pretty similar. The redesigned 2015 brings a new independent rear axle. Better for ride and handling.', 'All the of the posts so far are right to a point. The way I look at is if you can afford it go for it. Anyone can buy a late model Mustang. A 60’s one will stand out. I used to ride a custom Harley. Yes it rode a little ruff, but when I pulled in anywhere mine stood out from the rest. But that’s me I like to be different.\nA 60’s one in good condition with some upgrades can be a daily driver. Disk brakes and elc ignition would be my first upgrades. These are easy upgrades for most DIY’ers.\nPeople die everyday in new cars just as they did in old ones. Do you think a Smart Car is safe in a crash with say a pickup? I all most hit a Saturn in the drivers door with my haft ton 4x4 pickup at 50 MPH. If did do you think the girl would have lived? The cop and I did not think so.  If I have to live everyday worrying about being hurt or dying because of what I drive, why would I want to live? Is a new motorcycle any safer than any 60’s car?  Buy what you want, live for today and whatever you buy have it checked out top to bottom.', 'Death rate in the 60s was FIVE TIMES the death rate now.  Not a small difference.  No way to address most of the problems.', 'So what if it is? People get hurt and die everyday, it’s a fact of life. Sill no reason not to live life to it’s fullest. “No way to address most of the problems” Just as with a new car. Look at GM or Toyota. All of the recalls. Makes you feel safe?

He was still driving when he died at 86 and never hurt himself  or anyone else.\nOn the other hand I know a 98 year old snowbird who drives herself form Western NY to Florida and back every year who doesn’t need glasses for distance or reading.\nMy gas pedal to brake reflexes were the fastest of any of our 50 or so school bus drivers and I was in my 60s when they stopped testing us. They used to throw out some of my times because “I must have been guessing”  even though I never red lighted.\nThe Buffalo News had an article a few years ago about a 102 year old Williamsville woman who still lived alone and drove to her 78 year old son’s house every day to fix him a hot meal.', 'My deepest sympathy for your Mothers premature death. That is why I start my M/T car in neutral. I have been drowned in safety and I am probably excessive. I now at only 64 years old realize I am not the driver I was in my 20s and know my limits. I hope I can continue for a few more years.

I don’t see any older people texting or talking on the phone while driving.  Yet that is a very common phenomenon, among younger drivers.', 'Oops! Here we go again. This hitting the wrong pedal relates to my belief that older people should be taught to brake with the left foot, assuming automatic transmission.\nOlder people may (or of course may not) lose track of exactly where their feet are, and thus simply think they are on the brake when they are on the throttle.\nThe only argument besides, well, we’ve always braked much as we always use qwertyuiop keyboards. Just cause, is that there are bad drivers who ride the brakes with left foot braking.\nYou can’t teach people not to ride the brakes when braking with your left feet, if you tell them not to brake with the left foot.\nContrary to those who have very fast throttle-to-brake responses, braking with the left foot gives much faster response times.\nIn NYC commercial drivers are specially trained to use both feet. In other places it is allegedly illegal to do it. This is one of the last blue laws.', 'We had a Somali lady (middle age) do the same thing to a store downtown.  Hit the gas, jumped the sidewalk, and into the store front.  No one injured though.  Someone tried to take out the Chinese restaurant too before that but I don’t recall the particulars of the driver.  I guess we just need to realize that driving is dangerous regardless of a person’s age.', 'Maybe if they drove manuals it would be safer.\nI know the DMV tests the older drivers more frequently here in CA. Also their family doc could cancel their license. It should be part of their yearly physical to go through their reflexes/etc.\nThe problem is that without a car for the most part when you can not drive, you are stuck at home.\nMy parents, now in their 80’s gave up driving quite a few years ago. Dad can’t see and mom can not put up with other driver’s craziness; at least that is what she says.\nUber has been somewhat of a lifesaver as of recent. They can at least go to doctor’s visit/grocery shopping and is cheaper than a cab ride.\nI also gotta say, I have read quite a few younger drivers driving in stores or crowds, so it is no age only.', 'Man is THIS a can of worms! There is serious resistance on the part of older drivers to relinquish the wheel and for good reason. They’ve built their lives around the car and do not wish to change as they approach the age that they should no longer drive. And that age is different for everyone. You can be 60 and and be impaired enough to give up driving. Or you can be 95 and be completely competent behind the wheel. Heck I now of a 72 year old man that won a national championship sports car title! States are loathe to put ANY restrictions on older drivers because they vote! The other problem is that if ALL drivers were tested on a regular basis, a significant percentage of drivers of every age would fail. It makes it very tough if not impossible for families to yank Dad’s license when the time comes.\nTwo examples in my family; My grandmother never drove. She lived in a apartment on a bus line specifically for that reason. At 72 she entered a senior living complex that provided transportation. Problem solved. She got along quite well without a car or a resident driver for many years because she planned ahead.\nMy mother, however, did not have a license until after my father died and she no longer had a chauffeur. She was adamant about getting a license at 62 because she was not willing to change her habits. She barely got a license as she was a terrible driver. As she passed 72 years old, her driving skills reduced to the “Ray Charles” parking method. Inch forward until you hit something. Her neighbors were afraid of her and begged me to take away her license. My state made that essentially impossible. I told them to call the police every time she hit one of their cars. We finally placed her in senior living as her health failed. Fortunately before she killed herself or someone else.\nIts a very hard problem to solve if the driver is not willing to solve it for themselves and virtually impossible to legislate.', '\n\n\n galant:\n\nI have read quite a few younger drivers driving in stores or crowds, so it is no age only.\n\n\nYup!\nCirca 2008, I was riding in my friend’s Accord and we were T-boned as we were about to exit from a gas station.   No, we weren’t merging onto the roadway.   We were still at least 10 feet from the curb when a crazy 40-ish year old woman driving a Lexus Rx careened off of US Route 1, drove over the curb onto the gas station property, and T-boned us.  The cops estimated that she was probably going at about 25-30 mph when she hit us.\nNeedless to say, the Accord was totaled, but–luckily–its design protected us from injury.   Thank God that she didn’t hit a gas pump!\nWhen the cop questioned the woman, she stated, “The harder I pressed on the brake, the faster it went”.\nThe cop looked at her, and said, “Yeah, that’s what happens when you mistake the gas pedal for the brake”.\n', '@irlandes - Contrary to your assertion, all reflex testing has shown that, with few exceptions, right foot braking (assuming that is your gas pedal foot) is FASTER then two foot braking.  This has to do with the physiology of two foot braking requiring communication between both sides of the brain.  This takes longer than the processing required to use a single foot and therefore only one side of the brain is involved.  I wouldn’t have believed it but I have tried the reflex test in a driving simulator and watched others try it as well.  Nobody that I observed, including myself, had better times using two feet.', 'I can appreciate that older drivers don’t want to give up their mobility but aging degrades our vision and reflex times.  The problem is not necessarily older drivers but bad drivers and many of us good drivers become bad drivers as we age.\nTwo observations - 1) Not getting into an accident is not the only measure of how good you are as a driver.  Many bad drivers cause accidents that they drive away from without a scratch.  2) Older drivers almost never perceive that their driving skills are diminished. My father (80 years old) was once a GREAT driver and now he is a menace.  In his opinion his skills are not diminished.  I have sat in his car.  I would say that his perception, like many aging folks, is completely biased and he is offended that none of us children will ride with him now.\nThe reality is that we need better and more regular testing of ALL drivers to maintain driving privileges.  Better and periodic testing will catch more bad drivers and weed out any aging drivers who no longer have peripheral vision, sufficient reflexes, or overall vision that make driving a dangerous endeavor for them and those traveling on the road with them.', 'In Illinois, a drivers license is good for four years for age 60 something to 79, then two years 80 to 86, then every year after 87. Requires in person visit, with vision test and a road test.\nEvery administration has to walk a fine line; you are dealing with the age bracket where EVERY one votes, and they do not want to feel picked on.', 'We had to take away my mother-in-laws car years ago. And in reality we probably should have a couple years earlier. I understand they don’t like it, but it’s for their safety and everyone’s else on the road.', 'Sorry. Fake news. It takes at least two weeks to retrain the brain. So, of course if  you take people who always brake with their right foot and test them, they are slower. Try it again with those who have been braking with their left foot for a long time.\nIn close calls, I have the car half stopped while you right foot brakers are still moving the foot over.\nStop and think what we are talking about… Old people who get confused which pedal their right foot is on, and thus kill people, and you are still concerned about response time? Totally strange.\nAlso, I have noticed that many people on this board have no problem condemning old people to a horrible life when it is not necessary. If an old person is really a danger, fine. But, to do it when left foot braking will solve the problem is vicious.', 'Before you (some of you) begin beating up on older drivers and trying to make us jump through hoops, you may want to look at this chart of auto accidents by age. There are countless others that show similar distributions.\n', 'Whatever the solution, this is a subject where your views change as you yourself become the old person everyone else is talking about.  Just like every other 70+ person, I was younger once, and things seemed so much simpler.  Now, not so simple.  The only thing I can imagine that could happen, given politics and government finances, is some sort of testing device that a driver would have to pass, attached right onto the car, before the engine would start.\nSome states are experimenting with a breathalyzer that you have to blow into before the car will start, and they use it as part of the probation for a repeat offender.  Sure, you can beat the system by using a different car, or getting your kid to blow into the thing for you, but that requires a bit of planning.  Lots of drinkers just don’t think ahead that far, and if the thing keeps a few off the road, great.\nSo, some sort of video test that requires that the driver respond to cues and operate controls at a certain degree of accuracy could help.  And it’s possible that even the challenge of starting and running the test itself could disqualify some drivers.', 'Anyone can hit the gas instead of the brake.  Many years ago a young gal was leaving the side street our church was on, roared out to the main street and swerved into a concrete wall. She was OK, the car was not.  She told the cops the brakes did not work, they pressed on the brake pedal and it was solid.  They figured she hit the gas and panicked. So young and old can make the same mistake.', 'Peripheral neuropathy can creep up on people with borderline type 2 diabetes. When wearing work boots I am unable to feel the difference in stepping on the brake pedal and the accelerator. And while that hasn’t resulted in any serious problems I have occasionally let my foot slip off the brake pedal when stopped while wearing boots. Luckily my habit of stopping several feet behind the car ahead has allowed me to avoid an accident.', '\n\n\n SteveCBT:\n\nAnyone can hit the gas instead of the brake.\n\n\nIt’s far more likely for a driver to hit the brake AND the gas together in an emergency situation if the driver’s muscle memory is developed around braking with the left foot. We’ve had this debate before. This is bad driving practice.\nWith respect, irlandes, I was taught many years ago how bad this practice is and I still these many years later believe braking with the left foot to be a bad practice.']",42,5.1k

IMHO there is no category better equipped, trained, proven, and deserving of our support in the open carry of firearms than our combat veterans.\nI would rather be among a giant crowd of armed combat veterans than one of you. Remember that the only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun.\nI’ll go even further. EVERYONE should serve at least two years in the military immediately after graduation from high school or college, where EVERYONE will be trained in the use of firearms.

Combat veterans are far safer gun owners overall than those who don’t understand or recognize what a gun can actually do, and than those who’ve never been trained in gun safety.\nEvery citizen should be allowed to own guns, and those who abuse that right by misusing guns for the commission of crimes or violent acts should be removed from society. Those who abuse guns to commit crimes should be subjected to restriction and oversight, not veterans who didn’t commit crimes. I would even argue that there would be less violent crime if open-carry were allowed, accepted by society, and considered normal…   combined with beginning to provide and enforce serious prison sentences for those convicted of violent crimes.

There were also other European nations to worry about. A large standing military was fiscally impossible at that time so the solution was a large civilian militia. Even if a large standing military were possible the founding fathers were rightfully concerned of it being used to establish a tyrannical government from within which was certainly not unheard of in Europe.\nPEOPLE: For the United States of America to maintain true free nation status the citizens had to retain the means of defending themselves individually and their nation collectively.\nI have raised my hand and swore to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic 5 times. The last time was 2004 but as far as I know there is no expiration date.\nWhy has it been made so complicated?', '“Minority Report” of course!']",19,1.1k

NEED HELP ASAP,Safety,"['honda', 'accord']",oldtimer_11,"['Bing', 'mmurphy542', 'the_same_mountainbike', 'COROLLAGUY1', 'George_San_Jose1', 'insightful']","I had recently bought a 1994 Honda accord from a couple that had it sitting in their driveway for a while. When I got it home & looked at it then I could tell that it had to of sat for at least a good year or 2.
The entire brake system was shot so I replaced all 4 brake calipers(the back has disk brakes),
both of the front brake hoses,
all 4 of the back brake hoses,
all brake pads
both front rotors and ball bearings,
& the master cylinder 4 times.
The car wasn’t applying any brake pressure until I replaced all of that, then all the brakes kept locking up.
I figured that it could of been air in the lines so I bleed all the brake lines. I was using a 1/4"" vinyl tubing and a empty clean pop bottle to bleed the brakes so It could be done by 1 person.
The driver side front, passenger side front & back were bleeding just fine but the driver side back kept giving me air for 2 days in a row so i used a different 1/4 vinyl tubing and the air slowly began to stop.
I had bleed the brakes again after that with the car off while going through 32oz of dot 4 brake fluid through each caliper. (says to use dot 3 or dot 4, Dot 4 has a higher boiling point than dot 3)
All the brakes were locking up when i let the car get warm & now I got the brakes working just fine until i go a mile then i can feel the brake peddle start stiffening up(becoming more sensitive) from almost being all the way on the ground(3/4 of the way down) to come to a hard stop to going 1/4 of the way down for a hard stop after another mile. I took the car home & the driver side front tire, passenger front & back tires were hot but not smoking yet while the driver side back had almost no heat.
I almost didn’t touch the brake peddle during this entire time & when I pressed it then it was just enough to come to a normal slow stop
The only other things that i can think of would be a leak in the ABS modulator where the O rings are (but i can’t see anything leaking from the modulator) or I really didn’t want to believe this at all but I did accidentally break the ABS speed sensor on the passenger front tire with a hammer when i was trying to get the captive rotor off so could that be the entire problem on the brakes sticking & slowly locking up?
I am running out of ideas on what the problem could be cause i never messed with the brake booster itself so I doubt that’s the problem.
The worst the car has was the driver side was side swiped but no real damage except to the mirror.
I found the brakes locking up at one point cause the ABS modulator was out of brake fluid but if that was the case then I couldn’t get the car out of the driveway.
After every time i bleed the brakes then they would work just fine until the next day & then I had to open a bleeder screw on both lines just to relive the pressure which worked for a few hours & then the brakes would lock again.
I lubed the brake caliper pins on the front so I wouldn’t have to hear about that again.
Anyone got any ideas? I’m running out of ideas cause I’ve talked to half a dozen mechanics about it, all of the people at O’Rileys, auto zone, napa & brakes plus along with a dozen random people that get interested in what I’m doing when I’m talking to these automotive guys & none of them know.

It’s a canister with a diaphragm in it through which traverses  the brake rod. Your pedal is on one end of the rod, behind the booster, and the master cylinder pistons are on the other end of the rod, in front of  the canister.\nWhen the system is static, a valve in the diaphragm assembly allows the pressure/vacuum on both sides of the diaphragm to be equal and the canister sealed off from atmosphere, leaving the diaphragm just sitting. When you brake, the aforementioned valve allows the vacuum from the engine to pull the diaphragm forward when you brake while venting the rear surface of the diaphragm to atmosphere, helping you apply the brakes. When you release the brakes, the diaphragm returns to it neutral position, the valve assembly seals the entire canister and allows the entire canister to equalize, stopping the diaphragm from doing anything useful.\nConstantly increasing brake line pressure is generally a failure of the booster valve assembly to completely seal the canister and allow the pressure/vacuum on the diaphragm’s front and rear surfaces to equalize fully. As the diaphragm slowly pulls the brake rod forward, the valve assembly begins to operate as if the brake were slightly applied.\nPerhaps the most definitive way to test this is to clamp off the vacuum line to the engine. It needs to be clamped to prevent the engine from experiencing a vacuum leak. The brakes will be very firm without the booster assist, so do this test carefully. If the problem disappears, it’s the booster.', 'If the booster is putting the brakes on, I would think the brake pedal would sink lower.  Does this happen?

Rio Rancho speed van goes up in flames, police say 16
Rio Rancho Police are investigating a possible arson after finding the speed enforcement van on fire late Wednesday night, according to a spokesman. Captain Ron Vigil said officers, along with the fire department, responded around…





","['If it is arson, I hope they catch the perp.', 'The way catching speeders is enforced is nothing new.\nThe commute in the Boston area…before you get into real heavy traffic - average vehicle speed is 75. And some doing 90+. The police are checking for speeders on the OPPOSITE side of the highway where there is little to no traffic. In the 30+ years I’ve lived in the Boston area I’ve never seen any traffic enforcement for commuter traffic.\nEvery small town has their own traffic areas, and they are NOT there to make it safe. They are doing it for revenue. Towns even have in their budget how much they need from speeding tickets each year. The few towns that actually try to decrease speeding instead of collecting revenue start seeing drastic revenue if they give out too many tickets…people stop speeding through those areas. Gee…you’d think that would be the goal.', 'LOL, I remember living in a small town back when every line item of the budget was voted on at town meetings. We got a new police chief one year, a young fella trying to make a name for himself. Based on his data, we approved a few more cops and another squad car. Well, that next year everyone was getting caught in speed traps. He came before the next meeting wanting more cars and more cops. Man, did he get verbally beat up. Numerous residents lined up to speak. Comments were “you’re asking me for more cars and cops so you can set up more speed traps? You have got to be kidding.” Needless to say, he did not get what he asked for. He got his head handed to him.\nYeah, the fake car has been used in many places to catch speeders. IMHO it stinks.

She suddenly stops in the middle of a lane and turns 90 degrees facing traffic with her arms extended to the side. A mini van barely stops without hitting her! She continues standing there until the van pulls forward and hits her! A witness reported some sort of verbal confrontation was involved. (Daring the driver to hit her?) The van left the scene and she went to the hospital. She has serious but not life threatening injuries. My best guess is that she is one of the wacko protesters who blocked streets, bridges, and even interstates in November/December 2016. It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad world!!! Was this a I’m crazier than you contest that she lost? I would never hit a pedestrian, cyclist, or vehicle on purpose.

I’m thinking in those days, it wouldn’t have been wise to contest a ticket.  Small community and all, your neighbors could make life difficult for you', 'Speed cameras, and radar traps are more about revenue enhancement than anything else.  With that said, resorting to arson is not the best way to get your point across.  Fortunately the police in my area really don’t bother you unless you’re doing more that 15 over the posted limit during the daytime, at night they’ll pull you over for doing anything more than 10 over the posted limit, there are no speed cameras and there are no “speed vans”.  I’ve asked a few local police officers about (I’m friends/acquaintances with a number of them, and it’s proved beneficial over the years), and they all say that while they do get revenue from traffic tickets, that the sheriff’s department is so well funded vs. the actual needs of the county, that they really don’t have to rely on traffic tickets to make ends meet, and that they like to concentrate on of more serious matters.  To me that’s both good and bad. Good in the sense that they don’t need 1/2 the force to spend their shift writing tickets for arbitrary reasons, but bad in the sense that I’m probably paying more than I need to in taxes to fund a larger than needed police department.  I will add that crime in the county is low compared to the surrounding areas,  the biggest reported crime in my neighborhood over the past decade was that someone had a Garmin GPS stolen from their car around 4 or 5 years ago.  Really can’t complain about their effectiveness.', 'The cameras around here (MD) are either red light cameras or speeding cameras. The speeding cameras are in work zones, and they make sure that drivers do not exceed the normal speed limit. I can’t think of a work area with cameras where the speed limit is lowered due to construction. In many cases, the work area is separated by Jersey walls, but trucks occasionally move in or out of traffic there, so the extra effort makes sense. The red light cameras I’m aware of seem to be at dangerous intersections. Other than that, the police seem to go fast and ignore everyone else going fast. I guess they could have more important business.\nD.C. Is different. They have speed cameras to welcome you to town and say good bye on the few highways inside the city. Those do seem to be revenue generators.', 'They said they had 8 vans.  Does that mean they “had” 8 vans and now have 7, or had 9 and now have 8?  Just curious at $130,000 a piece, that’s quite an expensive program they’ve got there.  Being somewhat of a lifetime revolutionary, I have some sympathy when the populace rises up against a tyrannical government.  Nothing against reasonable enforcement of speed laws, but I’ll bet there’ll be a new mayor next election, and I’d have to recuse myself from serving on the jury.  Around here they just use those electronic signs with “your speed is” and flashing lights if you are over the posted.  I don’t know what they cost but nowhere near $130,000.\nLike Ohio though, it just about got above freezing today after a long sub-zero spell so I suspect that has some affect on my responses.  Hoping Orlando warms up by the end of the month.', 'From the article;\nAnnemarie L.

Over the past 10 years it has taken her on road trip adventures all over the country. Other than a few minor parts falling off here and there (trim, door handle, belly pan) it has been sturdy and reliable.  I used to drive it, and personally still miss its turn-on-a dime turning radius and 360 degree visibility. What a great car!  She now has the opportunity to inherit her grandparents’ 2004 Prius 4-door sedan with front and side airbags that has 28,000 miles on it.  We, her parents, feel this is a safer option at this point in the Volvo’s lifespan, and are pushing her to switch from the Volvo to the Prius. I want to be sure we are giving her the best advice, since I worry, despite the more modern safety features of the Prius, that switching from a hefty tank to what seems to me to be a tin can (the Prius) may actually be less safe.  She drives on freeways with semis, and I feel the Prius will squish in an accident versus the indestructible Volvo.  On the other hand, if the Volvo breaks down in a dark alley, that is not safe either.  My daughter does not work on cars, though she has a good mechanic, and will likely be pouring more and more money into the Volvo for upkeep.  But the real reason for considering the change is safety.  We’ve already researched all the online safety ratings but they are difficult to compare given the ages of the cars as well as the difference in size class.  (Of course we are taking into account what she will lose by switching from a classic car (nods and waves from fellow 240 owners) to a stodgy politically correct vehicle.)  What can you tell my daughter about the relative safety of these two choices?","['I hesitate to spout off but while the newer car will have air bags and crush zones to absorb an impact, I think she should drive what she wants and what she is comfortable with.  These features only are useful in an accident so the goal should be to avoid accidents, then its a moot point.  I’ve put on over a million miles and haven’t had a moving accident since 1968 and many of those miles were in older cars without air bags or crush zones.  I never felt unsafe.  So I would recommend rather to enroll her in a National Safety Council approved defensive driving class to learn accident avoidance techniques.  Learning about maintaining safe zones all around the car, safe following distances, anticipating errors by other drivers, and so on, will contribute more to long term safety than air bags.', 'If I’ve found accurate specs, the “tin can” weighs more than the “tank”, so there’s some food for thought.', 'I’m guessing the daughter is 25 or older.  Time for the parents to let go, it is her decision.\nThe Prius is safer.  The Volvo has more room and a great roof for carrying things like bikes and kayaks.', 'Contrary to the OP’s beliefs, that “tank” is actually far less safe in a collision than most modern small cars.     When the Volvo was built, it was very safe–for that time period.   However, the advances in safety engineering in the 23 years since it was designed means that it greatly lags modern cars–even fairly small ones–in terms of passenger protection.\nTake a look at this comparison of a Volvo “tank” and a small, much newer  Renault “tin can” when they collide, head-on:\nyoutube.com/watch?v=qBDyeWofcLY', 'The Prius is probably safer.', 'Does the Prius have a takata air bag?', 'Agree that the Prius is probably much safer than the “tank” Volvo. Volvo pioneered safety, but that was a long time ago. The  “tank” qualities probably refer to the fact that the body is not rusted out yet, not how safe it is. That would only become apparent in and accident.\nSo, put the Volvo myth to bed and have her try out the much safer Prius.\nThe prior clip says it all!', 'Prius.  It is safer, more reliable, and much less expensive to keep running.  At this age, repairs to the Volvo are really maintenance items.  Everything that has not been replaced or repaired will need it much sooner on the Volvo than the Toyota.', ""between its ability to direct energy around the passengers, its ability to absorb energy through “crush zones”, its air bags, and its other safety features, the Prius is far, far safer than the '93 Volvo. And will be far more reliable.

Unfortunately, that guy was unable to comprehend this example of some fairly basic physics.', 'Sigh! so many people are unable to understand basic physics (and basic math). I think the very term “physics” turns a lot of people off.', 'One more reason to go with the Prius - even though the Volvo was made in 1993 (the last year for them), it was first made in 1974.  So it’s a 40+ year old design.  MUCH has improved since then.', 'Volvo pioneered the crush zone body with the 240, and it was a very remarkable car for its time.

Thats just progress.\nBut, why can’t she have both cars.  Use the Prius for her daily drive and the Volvo for hauling stuff.  She should only need the basic insurance on the Volvo and if it is not used as a daily driver, the premium should not be very high.  The money she saves on gas should cover it.', 'I think the Prius will be safer but you have other issues. A 2004 Hybrid with such low miles could be a problem and need repairs pretty soon.

As today’s cars become more automated they require numerous sensors located around the vehicle. I assume the sensors are connected by wires to various controlling modules, and safe operation requires a steady stream of data from the sensors. What happens if an input is interrupted without warning as nearly happened to me when a wire from traction control was hanging on by a single strand after being nearly chewed off by a critter. Also my 4 wheel drive failed due to chewed wire.
Like many vehicle owners, I have a vehicle that is parked outside. And like many owners, I have continuous trouble with critters chewing on the wires. (The manufacturers don’t seem to care about this because the damage isn’t covered under the warranty).
I know a broken wire will throw a warning light and code, but what about one that hasn’t quite severed and separates while driving?
I guess my question is: - as manufacturers add more automated inputs, is the likelihood of failure increased by the additional opportunities for critters to cause problems?
Chris
Easton, PA","['Ray unfortunately doesn’t participate here (though we’d be delighted if he did!)\nIt goes without saying that autonomous cars will have error checking routines that test everything before the car moves, and while the car is moving. If a critical wire is chewed through the car will discover that and shut itself down until it’s fixed. Presumably while it’s moving it will at least attempt to move to a safe location before it shuts down.\nThere will also most likely be redundancy such that one wire being chewed through won’t disable the whole car while it’s running. For instance, in airplanes the control hydraulics are triple-redundant, which means you can lose the primary and secondary hydraulic systems entirely and still maintain control of the plane because there’s a third system as double-backup.', 'The auto manufacturers face additional liability for problems when they sell autonomous vehicles. It seems to me that if certain things are wrong, like your critter concerns, the car will park itself until the issues are resolved. It might, or might not, drive itself to the shop when told to do so, but that’s about as for as it would go.', '\n\n\n Chris_Taylor:\n\n. (The manufacturers don’t seem to care about this because the damage isn’t covered under the warranty).\n\n\nIt is not because they don’t care because the problem is a low percentage of vehicles effected and the task of building a vehicle that could not be effected would add an outrageous amount of money to vehicle cost.', 'Though it would help if they chose plastic insulation that wasn’t derived from plants such as corn.

I know some of the systems for self driving vehicles have multiple redundant systems all running in parallel.\nA lot of people seem to think that when autonomous vehicles become widely available we’d all at once have autonomous vehicles everywhere. It’s going to be gradual. First systems will also have manual controls so a human can easily take control (this is happening now with Uber cabs in Pittsburg).\nThese systems are still years away from final release. They’re in Alpha test right now. Which means there will be bugs and problems to solve. Then Beta…which means more bugs and problems to solve.\nTry not to judge autonomous vehicles on the technology today. The technology is changing rapidly. Software is changing and growing at tremendous rates. Even requirements are changing based on new bugs/problems they’ve encountered.', '\n\n\n Chris_Taylor:\n\nas manufacturers add more automated inputs, is the likelihood of failure increased by the additional opportunities for critters to cause problems?\n\n\nYup. But only when critters are part of the equation.\nIt’s commonly believed that the probability of failure increases with increased complexity despite the presence or absence of critters. However, modern cars’ failure rates are far lower, and modern cars’ longevity greater, than the cars I grew up with largely DUE to leaps in technology, in design, manufacture, and also in the cars themselves. Much of that could be and often is described as increases in complexity. Ergo, the theory of increased complexity increasing the probability of failure is clearly either incorrect or far more complex than the average person thinks. I think it’s the latter.\nWhat I believe will increase from critter damage because of increased complexity is not the likelihood of a failure, but rather the difficulty diagnosing the problem.']",0,486

“Texting while driving
SEPT. 9, 2016
It is unnerving to read the Sept. 3 piece about the nationwide epidemic of texting while driving. Over lunch recently, a retired friend was telling me about his early training as a machinist working with heavy-duty machine tools in the aircraft industry. The greatest emphasis was on focus while operating a metalworking lathe or a high-capacity drill press. Keep your eye and mind on the work in front of you, no chatting with your neighbor at the broaching machine, no holding coffee with one hand, no daydreaming about girlfriends or problems at home. Concentration on the job, first and foremost. Finally, did I know what was the highest-risk heavy machinery? The automobile, as potentially dangerous as the giant automatic screw machine, but not stationary, it’s rolling on wheels, really fast.

In NHTSA’s own words:
""The analysis found that DRLs have no statistically significant overall effect on the three target crashes. When combining these three target crashes into one target crash, the drl effects were also not statistically significant. When examined separately for passenger cars and light trucks / van (LTVs) , drls in LTVs significantly reduced LTVs involvement in the target two vehicle by 5.7 percent. However, the remaining drl effects on these three target crashes were not statistically significiant. Although not statistically significant, drls might have unintended consequences for pedestrains and motorcycles. Particularly, the estimated negitive effects for LTV’s were relatively large and cannont be completely ignored.
“Currently the NHTSA is in the rulemaking process in response to General Motors (GM) petition to mandate DRLs. This report will affect the rulemaking decision. Therefore the report is considered to contain ‘highly influential scientific information’.”

Sure, on the surface it seems like looking at accident rates for the new car with DRLs vs accident rates for the old car without would yield pertinent results.\nBut what other changes were made to the car when they put DRLs in it? Better handling? Better braking? Better visibility?\nAnd how were the cars maintained? A brand new car which has had no maintenance is just a brand new car. A 4 year old car which has had no maintenance may be running on bald tires and shot front brake pads.\nThe old car is more likely to be dirty than the new car because you stop caring about keeping it bright and shiny after the newness wears off. Maybe it’s the highly reflective, clean, fresh paint on the new car that makes it more visible.\nAdditionally, where are the controls for type of accident? I see that they threw out single vehicle crashes, but did they also throw out rear-end collisions? If I’m at a stoplight with a car in front of me, and the guy behind me has DRLs, that’s not going to help much if he’s not paying attention and plows into me.\nAnd then there’s the common sense aspect - if I’m driving along and fail to notice the 15 foot long shiny thing coming at me, adding a couple of dim little lights to it probably wont’ help much.\nIt reminds me of the fad where fire departments started painting their trucks that highlighter green-yellow color. Why? Because a study came out that showed there weren’t as many crashes involving yellow fire trucks as there were involving red ones. Then someone figured out - that’s because there aren’t as many yellow fire trucks, so naturally there are fewer crashes for that group.\nThere’s also the prevalence question. Sure, maybe during the changeover when hardly anyone had DRLs you’d notice a car with DRLs because you’re not used to seeing cars with their lights on in the middle of the day. Now that a large number of cars are DRL-equipped, it won’t register as prominently.\nBottom line for me is that I don’t know if DRLs enhance safety during the day. I suspect that even if they did when first introduced, the benefits will fall off as the number of cars equipped with them approaches 100%. If everyone’s got DRLs, no one’s going to notice DRLs.\nI do suspect that they decrease safety at night, because oftentimes people who forget to turn their headlights on are reminded to do so as soon as they get to a dark section of road and discover they can’t see. But with DRLs, they can see, and so they keep driving with no side or tail illumination.', 'I have talked to a lot of people who don’t know that their headlights don;t come on automatically, they think that because their DRLs are on, everything is on.\nIn MY we have had a law for many years now that you have to have your headlights on in the rain.

You can take the axle out entirely and not damage any of those components.\nI’m not sure your understanding of what a “wheel housing” is is accurate, as what you can see of the wheel housing should be plastic which does not rust. Which components exactly are you saying are rusted? And in what way do you think storing it outside at the body shop rusted them when storing it outside in your driveway would not have?\nIf the way you’re writing here is how you’re communicating with your insurance company, you’re not doing yourself any favors. You need to write in a calm and rational manner, whereas here you’re coming off as though you’re screaming and ranting. The insurance company needs to know to take you seriously.\nWhat exactly is your theory as to how the axle broke the brakes?\nIt’s really sounding to me like the body shop did a crappy job repairing your car, and the insurance company wants to wash its hands of the matter. Who’s your insurance? Progressive is one that’s known for pulling stunts like this.\nAt any rate, I’m still having a hard time parsing what exactly you’re saying is wrong with the car, but if I have this right and the insurance company is trying to say that you do not need an alignment following suspension work then they are dead wrong.\nFor the rest, I’ll ask that you start over and explain clearly what was wrong when you filed the insurance claim, and what’s wrong now.']",0,633

A city police cruiser was number one in the left lane. Our light turned green and 2 vehicles blatantly ran the red light.

But the chances are quite low, so I don’t know if it is worth it.","['A CO detector is really only needed in a car that isn’t well maintained. If the exhaust system is complete and leak free, there is no danger. Even less danger with a modern fuel injected car as the exhaust has very little CO in the exhaust stream.\nThe issue you may have seen recently with Ford Explorer police vehicles and CO is due to a cracked exhaust manifold allowing gas to leak under-hood and into the fresh air intake when the SUV is idling and stationary.

People died from CO poisoning stuck on I-90 during the “great blizzard of '78”…  and I’m not exaggerating.\n\nAll gas engines need to have their exhaust vented to the outside.

Official data shows that approximately 200 people die in the U.S. every year from CO poisoning, some in cars.\nOf particular danger are blizzards. Those of us who have been stuck (unable to travel from ones current spot) in a few in our lives can appreciate the need to keep warm, but there should always be an inch of opening in the windows to prevent CO poisoning. In severe blizzards the exhaust cane become restricted and CO make its way into the passenger cabin. Granted, in today’s world of low CO emissions, much smaller and cleaner engines, and rust-resistant stainless steel exhausts, the danger is lower than it was in my youth of dirty-running carbureted V8 engines with steel exhausts prone to rot holes, but the risk is death, so all precautions must be observed.\nNOTE: you will NOT realize you’re falling asleep. I have personally blacked out from lack of oxygen to the brain, and you don’t even know it’s happening. One moment you’re sitting there and the next you’re waking an hour or two later…  or not. \nCarbon Monoxide is deadly. Always take all precautions.

That number excludes pedestrians, those who died in motorcycle or bicycle accidents, and those who died riding in an unenclosed cargo area or trailer.\nMost of the children who died were not wearing seatbelts — nationwide, 43 percent were unrestrained or improperly restrained. Another 15 percent were sitting inappropriately in the front seat, and 13 percent were riding in cars driven by somebody under the influence of alcohol.\nResearchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas carried out the analysis, which was published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The primary source of the data was the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe researchers found considerable variations in children’s deaths from state to state. In New Hampshire, for example, all of the five children who died during the study period were properly belted in. But in Mississippi, 56 of the 99 who died were not wearing seatbelts, or were not wearing them properly.\nThere were 0.25 deaths per 100,000 children in Massachusetts, compared with 3.23 per 100,000 in Mississippi.', ""Yeah, a newspaper headquartered in NYC writing about cars whose authors likely don’t own a car and may not have a driver’s license.

So injuries are the major cause of death of youth?  No kidding Captain Obvious, like heart attacks are a major cause of death of those over 65 whether wearing belts or not.\nObviously though if I was beyond my quota of reading NYT articles and got locked out I’m not blindly just looking at one media outlet.

I bet (but don’t know) that most kids are belted, so the odds of a belted kid dying are much lower than a non-belted kid.  If 80% are belted, and 20% not belted, but 50% of the deaths are not belted, it’s much more dangerous, right?', 'Well I did read the article.  It said first “most kids that died were unbelted” then “43% of the kids who died were unrestrained” (not exact quotes but from memory).  First of all 43% is not most.  51% would be most but one would expect more like 60% or 70% to qualify as “most”.  True it doesn’t say how many drivers belt their kids but on the other hand we are talking about the small percentage of people who actually get involved in fatal crashes compared to everyone else on the road.\nI guess I just see the article as fairly useless and the study somewhat flawed.  I just don’t see the point in the article.  Of course people die in accidents and of course people who are not belted in tend to die more, so again back to Captain Obvious.  Not to be too negative on the whole thing but I suspect someone got a grant to compile the data and I suspect that someone had some space to fill in the newspaper.']",26,1.7k

Is it really worth it? Will it affect my car battery in any way? There is an option to only have it record when the car is moving, but that would mean it wouldn’t catch bumper damage if someone backed into me and just left…
I have three weeks left to return it. It cost me $75 and the micro SD was another $10.","['Are air bags and seat belts worth the cost?  If you never have an accident no, but the one time you do they are worth a fortune.  Same with a dash cam.

The physical evidence may lead to you being at fault, but the dash cam will prove otherwise.  Are there other simpler ones you can get?

If it proves your innocence for a ticket or the other’s culpability in a lawsuit it is money well spent. It could also prove your guilt if you are, indeed, guilty. Which do you think you’d be?\n\n\nThat’s the important question to consider. Steve Lehto is an attorney who writes columns in automotive publications, and he’s pointed out several times that a dash cam is a gift and a curse. It’s great if some jerk wrecks into you and then lies about it, but it’s pretty terrible if you cause the wreck and the dashcam leads to increased penalties/civil judgments against you.\nHe also points out that if you do cause a wreck, and you have a dashcam running, and you decide to delete the footage, you can be found guilty of destruction of evidence, which will compound your legal difficulties.\nAnother consideration is whether or not the dashcam records audio - in 2-party-consent states, if it records audio when you’re not in the car, you might be found to be in violation of wiretapping laws. So when you catch the jerk at the dealership joyriding in your car, and there’s audio of it, if he claims he wasn’t aware he was being recorded, you might invite trouble.\nMy dad was a lawyer, and if he were around today, he would never have a dashcam. The potential for trouble would, for him, outweigh the potential good it could do. Of course, dad always was pretty far into the “eliminate liability” camp - we never had a swimming pool growing up because he didn’t want the potential liability of some kid breaking into the yard and drowning in it, for instance. Not all lawyers are as cautious as he was regarding potential liability.', 'Seems like the older I get, the less I understand.\nI’d include dash cameras, Go Pro cameras, and Facebook/social media in that bucket.\nBut to each his own.', 'I think the liability issue is an interesting take on it.  You cannot assume you will always be in the right and the dash cam can be used against you.  Also you may be hit from the back or side and the camera will do little good.  One reason why we had short retention schedules for emails and then were destroyed.  If documents are destroyed according to established retention schedules, they cannot be used against you.  Of course in a computer nothing is ever totally destroyed and someone else may have a copy, but you get the idea.', 'Yes, wiring it is the least of your problems. You can hack in the fuse box under the dash and find an unused fuse that is only on when the car is running and use that as the power source. That is what I have done for my wife’s car rear view camera/monitor and it has not drained the battery.\nNow, as far as the legal part, this is tricky. I guess in Russia this is a big problem because most drivers are not following the rules and the police presence is not that great either.\nIn US, the odds of someone plowing into you when you have the green light is not that high, but still does happen. But it might also catch you flooring it on yellow or some other situation that might at least put you partially at fault.', 'Whether it’s worth it depends on how long it takes to get stolen. ', 'Recently I started to  leave my dash cam plugged in the cigarette lighter at all times. There is no excessive power draw; it has never given me any problems and the car is not driven daily.', 'You can get a USB adapter, for the powerpoint, no wiring needed.

Parked BMWs bursting into flames leave owners with questions 9
Vehicle owners and fire departments across the country are asking BMW to explain how some parked cars could suddenly burst into flames.
An ABC News investigation airing today on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir and Nightline...





What do you think ?","['BMWs are electrical nightmares. It would not surprise me if BMWs had wiring faults that caused fires.\nThat said, this story doesn’t show evidence of that. I counted 11 separate BMW’s (if you count the Mini they snuck in there) in the article, with years spanning from around 2003 to today. In those years they’ve sold nearly 4 million cars in the US alone.\n11 cars out of 4 million is not indicative of a pattern. In fact, to find things that are less likely to happen based on this story, you have to start talking about winning the Powerball, or getting hit by a meteor.\nIf the “journalist” had been more interested in facts and numbers and less interested in sensationalism and Darth Vader costumes, I might be swayed into wondering if this were true. But as it stands, it’s just a BS story trying to scare people into watching the newscast.\nI will also point out that this is a “book” month, which happens 4 times a year. It’s the period in which the Nielsen ratings company measures viewership. That measurement is used to determine how much stations can charge companies to advertise on their air. You tend to see a lot of sensationalist BS during a book month because it’s a lot easier to spew out BS to draw eyeballs to your network than it is to do actual in-depth journalism.', 'I have to totally disagree with you.\nDon’t know about you, but getting your house burned down is as serious as it gets.\nIt’s very lucky no one has been killed.\nDo you work for BMW ?\nAnd the fact that BMW has no responded or offered any compensation speaks of a lack of responsibility and shows a cold-hearted company.\nI am sure there will be lawsuits that will “motivate” them to do the right thing.', 'I gotta go with @shadowfax here. The newest of the cars cited was 7 years old. BMW’s have dodgy electrical systems. The article says 5 million cars but gives no total number of fires. Sure its a small number, a very small number. I am sure BMW is looking into the problem but apologizing for something that may or may not be a problem opens up a can o’ worms, legally. You apologize and you own it, no matter what the real cause is.\nThe bottom line is: Any car can catch fire pretty much on its own. Fuel systems remain under pressure after the car shuts off. Damage to fuel lines from rocks or rodents can cause them to fail and leak. A car sitting for days before bursting into flames has had an electrical problem, more than likely. It happens. It happens to some VERY expensive cars at a MUCH higher rate - because the volumes are so low.\nhttps://www.autoevolution.com/news/what-s-with-all-the-ferrari-fires-42925.html 5\nIts a shame the house was burned but no one was hurt.

My sister’s house suffered fire damage when their Ford caught on fire in the garage.  I think that was traced to the faulty cruise control module or something.  At any rate the BMW problem is not fuel leakage after sitting for five days so most likely some type of electrical failure.  If current is flowing all the time and contacts in a component fail and heat up, guess it just depends what flammables happens to be near the failed component.

Yesterday it was KIA /Hyundai, then it was Toyota, and Honda, and Ford, and of course GM, and VW and Audi, and . . .and. . .\nJust as an aside, I contracted for some fire safety training at work once where we trained people in using a fire extinguisher.  Everyone put a fire out and it was drilled into us to shoot the extinguisher at the base of the fire not on top.  So then why are they sticking the hose under the hood instead of underneath?  They hose the cars and house down from the top down, instead of from the bottom up.  Just seemed like it had little effect on the flames.

Possibly, long term, better driving habits…\nnegatives: people have to pay a fine for breaking the law !\n(this is a negative ?? I consider it a positive)\nIn fact, with so many towns and cities short of funds, I would think this is a great source of revenue. i once stood at an intersection in downtown and counted violations per red light, and it averaged 3 per. When you do the math, 3 x # lights per hour x number of intersections x number of hours x fine, you get a large number, tens of millions of $ per month.', 'Red light cameras are a good idea. About 25 years ago, a neighbor couple were both killed when a driver ran a red light and collided with their car. If red light cameras had been used at the time, the killer might not have ignored red lights.', 'The problem with red light cameras is that darned “right to confront the accuser” part of criminal jurisprudence.  Pesky as it seems it is a fundamental cornerstone of our justice system.  When a cop pulls you over for a violation you can, at your discretion, choose to confront him or her in a court of law to make your case.  A camera will not come to court to testify to road conditions (slippery from ice), safety conditions (an emergency vehicle coming through with lights and sirens causing traffic to “make way” without regard to traffic signals), or to admit that the driver stopped first, THEN rolled forward to make a right on red.  All of these things happen, and more, yet the driver is left without anyone to confront who could admit to any of these circumstances that would cancel the ticket.\nThe problem with our society is that the pendulum has swung so far in the opposite direction that we now believe any video without context, as opposed to not believing anybody without video proof.  Simply posting videos of supposedly criminal actions, however small or large, without context or explanation is a gross violation of all of our rights.  And in this day and age of viral videos and misunderstandings, who amongst us wants to be victimized by an internet smear campaign without a chance to defend ourselves (or our families) which the internet does NOT provide.\nBe careful what you wish for.  Most people who support such erosion of legal rights have never been wrongly accused or been victimized by overzealous technologies such as red light cameras.  There was a red light camera in Rochester, NY that became famous for ticketing many drivers that stopped and made a right on red (legally) because of where the camera was pointed.  It took years of wrangling and many wrongfully ticketed drivers (suffering outrageous insurance premium increases in addition to the ticket cost) before the city recognized the problem.\nOne more thing to consider.  Red light cameras are posted in urban areas, typically disproportionately in areas where minorities live and drive.  You don’t find many such cameras in white areas, particularly suburbs and rural areas.  Urban minorities find these to be a hidden tax on them because so many more of them are affected than white drivers who live and drive in suburbs and rural areas.  I’m not trying to start a fight on this, just pointing out how THEY see it.', '\n\n\n BillRussell:\n\nI never understood why people would be unhappy with red-light cameras…\n\n\nI didn’t understand it either, until AAA in NJ presented convincing statistical evidence that cars being rear-ended at intersections with red light cameras had increased drastically, while there was no evidence of a decrease in T-boning accidents at those same intersections.\nObviously, a T-bone collision is almost always more serious than a rear-ender, but AAA’s evidence was so convincing that the NJ legislature “did a 180”, and wound-up outlawing red light cameras in the state.', '“I never understood why people would be unhappy with red-light cameras…”\nIt’s not that hard to understand really, many people including me consider it a violation of our rights, mainly the 6th amendment.

Add to that if you do decide to fight the notice, it the towns/cities have to issue a ticket, and only then can you fight it, you can’t call the company or the person who monitors the equipment to testify in many cases, you only get to call the police officer who review the tape but who didn’t issue the ticket or the notice.\nNow I could go on and on, for the record I have NEVER been issued a Notice of Violation.', 'While Albuquerque got rid of red-light cameras, principally because red-light-runners didn’t like getting caught (as opposed to 6th-amendment-activism) neighboring Rio Rancho has continued using them, so it’s not universal.\nPrinciples don’t make the difference, sentiment does; in a community more sympathetic to law-breaking drivers than the people they run over (I have a long collection of slaps-on-the-wrist of drivers who run over bicyclists, pedestrians, equestrians, into other vehicles…)   I recommend that we broadcast their patriotic, 6th-amendment-celebrating, moral, Christian, red-light-running for everyone to see and celebrate their victory over oppressive government.

The other problem is that in order to fight the notice of violation, in some cases you have to pay to upgrade the notice of violation, to a ticket, then contest the ticket, the fee for the “upgrade” is sometime more than the notice of violation will cost you, and in general the notice doesn’t incur points while a ticket will, so you pay the fee, (which you won’t get back) take a day off of work, both of which will generally cost more then the notice will.

This is the third time this had happened in the past 6 months.
The first time it was towed to Advantage dealership and I was told it was a bad battery which did not make sense but the car was running after battery replacement so I took it home. The second time the dealership was closed - I was able to start the car a few minutes later and took the risk of driving home. The next day when I brought it in, I was told that the car was running and that they could not run any diagnosis. Thereafter, the car ran fine for 3 weeks before it happened again. This time I could restart it but the car would only move a few feet before stalling.
The service center has replaced the battery and alternator and say the car has no issues.  I had earlier asked the service adviser and service manager
to diagnose the safety issue first before replacing the alternator - otherwise they would not be able to replicate the safety issue.  But I have been told that the warnings and car behavior is normal under low voltage conditions.  I have also heard inconsistent messages from the dealership that indicates they do not understand or know how to diagnose and resolve this critical issue.

It was just really stiff because you were going slow. Is it possible that the engine stalled, but you were distracted by all the warning lights and didn’t realize it had stalled until you noticed the steering and brake pedal getting hard?\nThe reason I ask is that power steering is really only noticeable at low speeds. At higher speeds you could disable power steering entirely and never feel the difference. And power brakes work on a vacuum, which means that after the engine turns off, there’s still enough vacuum available for the brakes to feel completely normal the first time you press them.\nSo it could have stalled and still felt normal for steering and braking, but the first time you hit the brake pedal eliminated the vacuum so that the second time you hit it, it was stiff. Meanwhile, that first braking session slowed the vehicle down enough for the lack of power steering to become apparent.\nNow, all that said, I agree with you that it probably isn’t the battery or the alternator unless there was a loose wire somewhere - in which case they probably fixed the loose wire when they connected the new battery and alternator.\nI can tell you that my mom has a 2014 X3, and…  Well, no offense, but as far as electricals go, BMW sucks. Whoever’s doing the electrical design over there has his head in the clouds. He designs as though he thinks the car will always be operated in a sterile laboratory environment, and so there aren’t any “what if this goes wrong” contingencies. This is why mom pairing the wrong cell phone to the car killed the radio, the navigation system, and the climate control.\nI can also tell you that in her experience, everything that goes wrong with the car is blamed on a bad alternator and battery. When she brought me in with her once and I pressed the tech to explain why a battery capable of starting the car was too weak to unlock the doors, he just kept repeating “it’s a bad battery sir.”\nIn short, I’ve come to the suspicion from hers and other peoples’ experiences that BMW is not putting much thought into failsafes, and they’re not putting that much thought into training their mechanics to actually diagnose problems.', 'If you can design a power steering system and power brake system that work equally well with or without power (without adding much weight or expense), I’m sure the auto companies will buy it from you. Good luck with that!', 'They have already been invented.\nElectric power steering can work with the engine off, it runs from the battery.  Its been available for almost 20 years.\nThe same for brakes.

It is a servo-hydraulic system that is “brake-by-wire.” Installed on some M-B models about 12-15 years ago', '\n\n\n nitin_vaidya:\n\nNo the stall happened at the very end.\n\n\nHow do you know this?', '\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nI can tell you that my mom has a 2014 X3, and…  Well, no offense, but as far as electricals go, BMW sucks.

My pride is still dented - 20 years of crash-free driving then I’m scuppered in my own driveway because I was distracted.
=
I’ll say this in my defense: I was stressed out on this particular morning in mid-June. Stressed out and running late.
And so it was that I reversed out of my garage at a fair clip without properly surveying my driveway quite as I should have. What can I tell you? I was on autopilot.
The crunching sound and juddering halt immediately exposed my error of judgment. Yes, I had reversed my trusty Subaru Outback into a contractor’s Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck which was parked in my driveway. In the contest between an SUV and a pick-up, the SUV always loses. The Outback’s rear was decked in badly; the truck had a very slight crack in a taillight and some tiny bruising in the paintwork.
I would love to say that this was the end of the incident, but – oh no – it gets significantly worse.
After doing a cursory survey of the damage to both vehicles, and hastily yet emphatically apologizing to the contractor, I dashed off to get gas before my scheduled commitment.
At the pump I realized that I hadn’t taken any photos of the damage to my car and, as everyone who has completed Insurance Claims 101 knows, it helps to have pictures.
Oh drat. So I grabbed my iPhone and quickly took some snaps of my mangled rear bumper.
Still running late, I jumped back in the car and zipped onto the Post Road, aka Route 1, aka the busiest road in Westport (not counting the Wacky Races). I’d driven barely 100 yards when I heard something clunk off the back of the car. Oh crap, I thought: a piece of my vehicle has just fallen off.
But I was late, and the road was busy, and I figured that particular slice of well-manufactured Japanese auto plastic was unsalvageable anyway. So I kept on going. (This was a mistake, as you’ll see).
When I parked up at my destination some five minutes later, and went to grab my things, I couldn’t find my wallet.
Aaaargh!
I’m an idiot. I must have left it at home.
But I just paid for gas….
Which means that….
Gulp.
Oh no, oh no.
Oh crap.
IT WAS MY WALLET THAT FELL OFF THE ROOF OF MY CAR.
Yes, dear reader, I had put my wallet on top of my trusty Outback as I pumped the gas and took pictures of the damage inflicted earlier that same morning.

Come back soon for the next installment of Dreadful Driving Mea Culpa or How Stress Makes Anyone a Distracted Driver or Where’s Wallet?","['“Stressed out and running late.”\nKey Words:\nStressed Out\nRunning Late\nI hope that you have taken measures to ensure less stress and more time.\nThe stress and rushing takes a toll on your health, your possessions, and is hazardous to others around you.\nThe chain-reaction of problems that you described were a wake-up call.\nWhat have you learned ?\nHow’d you get a handle on it ?\nWhat are you doing differently ?\nI share the roads with “distracted” drivers and they are very hard to deal with defensively.\nCSA', 'Oh yes, I learned my lesson. And that was only half the story.', 'Here’s the other half:\nOh $%#@, I thought, as I realized my mistake.\nBut at least I knew exactly where I was driving when the wallet clunked off the roof. So I dashed back to that section of Westport’s Post Road.\nAlas, when I arrived at the scene it was worse than I had feared. The entire contents of my wallet were scattered over a hundred-yard stretch of the road, which is, by the way, four lanes wide. It was a very blustery day and that really `helped’ spreading all the items.\nThe wallet contained every conceivable important card (credit, debit, health insurance etc) and cash, but all I could see when I returned were library cards and business cards. Whatever. So I began playing chicken with the fast-moving traffic, trying to locate the more valuable cards. But there was not a trace of the actual wallet.\nI had to leave the site of doom and complete my commitment. When I returned to the spot an hour or so later I went into various stores near the scene, begging for them to call me if a customer handed in my battered wallet. Every store assistant looked at me with an expression that said “What kind of a freaking moron loses their wallet ON the Post Road?’’ I was too frantic to explain.\nUp to that point I had found pretty much every item from my wallet, including credit and debit cards. But then it dawned on me what was probably left in the wallet. Gulp. My driver’s license was in an inside pocket. I’m going to have to tackle the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles again, I think, and my heart sinks.\nUh oh.\nOh no.\nPlease say no.\nBut oh yes, my green card was stuffed into the wallet too.\nAnyone, ANYONE who has sweated blood and tears to get a permanent resident’s card will know why losing the card would cause such misery. In an instant, I got flashbacks of all the red tape I had to chew through, all the infinite personal and medical details I had to muster, all the nerve-racking months I had to spend waiting for the mysterious bureaucratic process to cough up permission to live in the USA.\nI broke into a sweat. Then got the shakes. And finally turned grey.\nIf the stress of having to replace the precious card wasn’t bad enough, there was another factor in my panic. In less than two weeks I was due to fly to the country of my birth with two kids, having spent close to $4,000 on plane tickets. (Even cattle-class seats on American Airlines aren’t cheap). And I wouldn’t be able to get back into the U.S. without my green card; I’d be turned back at immigration. And there was no way I could get a new card in the 10 days before we were due to fly out.\nWell, I’ve really screwed up this time, I thought. So with a heavy heart I went to the police station to report the loss. The conversation went something like this:\nME: “I need to report the loss of a wallet.’’\nWOMAN AT POLICE FRONT DESK: “Where did you lose it?’’\nME: “On the Post Road. It was on the roof of my car when I left the gas station.’’\nWOMAN: “That happens a lot. What was in it?’’\nME: “Driver’s license.’’\nWOMAN: “Anything else?’’\nME: “Green card.’’\nWOMAN: “You’re completely screwed.\nWell, she didn’t actually say it out loud, but that’s clearly what the look on her face implied.\nI spoke with the police officer, who was also fairly sympathetic, in an “I’m glad I’m not in your shoes’’ way. But he also mentioned the possibility/probability of identity theft, which hadn’t occurred to me until that miserable moment.\nNone of this would have happened, NONE of it, if I’d taken a deep breath before reversing out of my garage that morning.\n===\nBut folks, this sorry tale of driving dreadfulness actually had a happy ending, I’m pleased to report. Because against all the odds, just a few hours later, I got a call from the YMCA in Westport saying my wallet had been found in the men’s locker room.\nHow did it get there? Was there any cash in it? Who found it? Was my driving license in it? I honestly couldn’t give a toss. I only cared, intensely, about the green card.\nAnd it was in there. Hallelujah!!\n===\nI think I learned my lesson after this dreadful day. Stress is a REAL cause of distracted driving and I paid the price twice in one day for having my mind elsewhere when I was driving. But it could have been a lot worse: no one was harmed, and for that I’m grateful.\nSo, please, drivers take a deep calming breath before you drive your car anywhere – even if it’s your own driveway.\nAnd if you ever hear anything tumble off your car as you’re driving, check that you’ve still got your wallet.

They didn’t want to lose their investment until they could be shipped out and shot.  At any rate I member the emphasis on keeping that free space all around your car.  Front, back, left, right.

A baby is dead in Virginia. Now will the state do something about texting while... 16
An infant’s death in Loudoun County merits Richmond’s attention as road fatalities surge nationwide.





","['You don’t have to enact a law banning texting while driving to charge this driver with criminally negligent homicide. Make the driver pay a hefty price - lock the driver in prison, real prison, not the county lockup, for a significant amount of time. Publicize it, over and over to get the message across to everyone.\nPassing a law no one enforces (my state - I see it daily) to make already criminal behavior “criminal” makes little sense. It is very easy to scan your phone to see what you were doing at the time of the crash, so enforce it, if it is the law, and use it to make the case for criminally negligent homicide.\nMuch like DUI, public outrage needs to drive behavior of drivers and prosecutors.', 'One the one hand people complain about too much regulation, and on the other they ask for more laws.  It’s a never ending process, but no one can ever legislate away stupid.

The proposed solution: change the speed limit in the area from 30 to 15 MPH (not sure of the actual numbers, but close).\nThe dragsters were doing well over 60, so a 15 MPH speed limit would get them to stop ? I’m always amazed at the stupidity of politicians.', 'Ya gotta love Double Secret Probation!', 'I think technology is part of the solution.\nSpeed cameras in problem areas, like known drag racing stretches.\nI’ve posted before about cameras that simultaneously take pictures of license plates and the driver inside, with infrared flash on the driver so it’s not distracting.\nI think all travelers (drivers/riders and pedestrians) are just getting more careless.\nA couple weeks ago a skate boarder came down a hill and hit my bicycle, while I was standing still!\nHe clipped my front wheel (no damage to the bike) and tumbled onto the pavement.\nHe got up said “oh, sorry, my bad” and went on his merry way.\nA few days later a pedestrian jaywalking with his face buried in his smart phone walked into my bike; again while I was standing still.', '\n\n\n B.L.E:\n\nIf you can’t or won’t commit to the resources needed to enforce a law, making an even more draconian law will have little effect\n\n\nAbsolutely!\nTexting while driving (along with the use of hand-held cellphones for calling) has been a moving violation in NJ for a few years, and despite periodic warnings of an impending crackdown, I see this activity going on CONSTANTLY.

Lowering the speed limit on the other hand simply means changing a few signs and it looks like they did something.\nLaws don’t have to be draconian, they just need to be enforced.

Unfortunately people will continue to die and be injured regardless of what laws are passed.\nNot to take the driver off the hook but I have noticed often people just cross the road without even looking for cars.  They think the crosswalk or walk lights mean that everyone will just not make a mistake and stop for them.  I especially noticed it around the university where the kids almost dare you to run into them.  Parents need to take responsibility for their kids too and regardless of a crosswalk, watch for cars and take appropriate action.  Drivers and pedestrians often are distracted.\nOh and the Washington Post is among the growing list of newspapers that only allow a few articles a month to be read without subscribing.

Biggest Spike in Traffic Deaths in 50 Years? Blame Apps 1
Highway deaths have surged in the last two years, and experts put much of the blame on in-car use of smartphones and dashboard apps.





","['Why…why…this is such a surprise!\n;-]', 'Traffic deaths have steadily declined since the mid 50s. Lately, however, they are on the upswing again due to driver distraction. Here the fine for distracted driving is over $200 but the incidents keep increasing. We also have more single car accidents where the driver “lost control of the vehicle”. often on a clear day on an uncrowded road!', 'Although I think in-vehicle texting is a big deal - and I have acted on that in my own household - I have to take a dissenting view on this article and the many like it in the media.  First, if you look at the rate of deaths per mile driven the uptick in 2015 (latest data available) is about 3%.  That is not a huge increase given the normal variability of the numbers. Look deeper.  Where are the big increases in deaths related to motor vehicles coming from in the report?  Not car crashes.  Bicycles, motorcycles, and pedestrians.  Look even deeper.  For example, who are the bike-riders and when are they being killed?  Men, often at night.  Things are changing, but the rate of deaths from motor vehicles has been statistically flat since about 2009.  Figure 3 in the NHTSA release. The iPhone was introduced in 2007. Vehicle deaths are lower since that point in time.  I know this is not a popular set of facts.  About a third of the deaths from motor vehicles are from drunk people.  The rate of non-fatal crashes is not up.  Page 3 table 2.  Note that the table is absolute numbers, not per mile driven.  Keep in mind that as more miles are driven more accidents happen, so adjust for that fact, as the report does in some cases, but not all.  The report says that distracted driving deaths increased by about 280 from 2014 to 2015. That includes all distracted driving types, not just phones.', 'I was thinking about that today on a long motorcycle ride.  Both at my destination and on the highway, the electronic signs warned people not to text and drive.\n…and yet I saw something I consider just as dangerous: malfunctioning brake lights.  I saw four separate vehicles, each one with at least one burned out brake light, and this is fairly typical, in all parts of Florida where I travel on at least a monthly basis.  It’s not so bad when it’s the center brake light that is burned out, because it tends to never be the middle one that is the one working light.  It’s almost always one that could be mistaken for a turn signal before you realize it isn’t flashing.  After all, I learned to drive right before they became standard equipment.  In fact, my first car, a four year old 1985 Buick Skyhawk, didn’t have a center brake light.  The ones that really worry me are the ones with only one working brake light.  I’m always afraid I’m going to rear-end one of those idiots.\nI miss the days when Florida had basic safety inspections.  I know a lot of states don’t do them well, but getting rid of them completely rather than reforming them has to be costing lives, maybe not enough to concern people, but I wish someone in state government would do something about it.  I would write my state congressperson, but our state legislature is so red, I know it wouldn’t go anywhere.', 'I’d guess the reduction in 0-60 times for commonly used newer cars on the road these days is part of the reason. The availability of affordable cars with  fast accelerations seems like it is conducive to aggressive driving styles.', 'Let’s not forget the near record low prices for gasoline (factoring inflation) causing us to drive more than we used to.', 'Sorry, but I cannot blame the technology. I can only blame the idiots. They then blame the technology.\nIMHO until APs begin to drive cars themselves, the fault will ALWAYS be with the driver 100%.', 'Oregon has never had safety inspections. I see too many vehicles on the road that should have been scrapped long ago. Non functional tail/brake lights are quite common. Broken lenses “repaired” with red plastic wrap and duct tape.

As an engineer in the telecom industry, I’m much into the latest tech gear and apps. I love to play with what’s new. But I knew right away that texting and driving was dangerous. I’ve had text capability on a phone for over a decade…I’ve never ever texted while driving. Now that my vehicle has hands free cell-phone I will answer a call when driving. But won’t talk for long. When I’m driving…I don’t like getting distracted.', 'Yes, I am reviving a dead thread, but this current editorial cartoon is so relevant that I felt the need to post it.

Now everything is automatic, smooth, quiet, etc.  On a drive you start looking around for something to do while the car takes care of everything else.  Have we created a monster with all the accessories?  So are we blaming the result (texting/idiots), rather than the cause (automatic cars and freeways)?', 'Well, the way that certain car mfrs (GM, chiefly) are touting the internet ability that is built into their cars more than they are talking about any other features certainly doesn’t help.\nMy least favorite commercials currently are the Chevy ads in which all of the actor/model/“real” people participants are unable to say very much–other than, “WOW!”–when they are shown Chevy’s internet ability.\nHave you seen those ads?\nWow!

And it does seem to me that the driver is the single greatest variable in avoiding an accident. Whether driving heavily loaded trucks on wet and icy roads or dealing with inattentive drivers and all the other various problems that arise good drivers make up for bad drivers to  prevent a great many more accidents than those that do occur.']",17,1.8k
