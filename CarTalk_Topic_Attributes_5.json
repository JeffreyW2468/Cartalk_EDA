This afternoon I have an open time period (rare) and could go to make the purchase.  But my salesperson doesn\u2019t work today, so if I go a different salesperson would be making the sale.  I\u2019m thinking that if I went today, my original salesperson (who put in all the time) would lose out on any commission \u2026 and that seems disloyal since he did all the real work.

Consider that cheaper models will get you a newer car within your budget and that can be a good thing given you only drive 6000 miles a year.\n\n\nYes!\nRather than focusing on a specific make and model, the OP should be searching for a vehicle that has been maintained flawlessly\u2013or at least that has been maintained very well.    Even a make and model that has a history of very good reliability can become a money-pit of very high repair expenses if the previous owner(s) were lax with maintenance.\nA car that is being sold by an individual, rather than a dealership, has a decent chance of coming with maintenance records that can be compared to the vehicle mfr\u2019s maintenance schedule.   When people buy my cars, not only do they get every maintenance invoice, but they also get a chart that I compiled, which allows me (and future owners) to see exactly what services were done, as well as the date and the odometer mileage of each service.\nBut, as Mustangman mentioned, even a car that looks good to you will need to be vetted by a mechanic of your own choosing.    You will likely pay ~$100 for that type of detailed pre-purchase inspection, so you will only want to take that extra step with a vehicle that you are sure that you want to buy.    A mechanic can detect collision damage that you might not have been able to see, as well as incipient mechanical problems, and can steer you away from a vehicle that would be a monetary risk for you.", "What\u2019s your budget?", "Good advice!

Therefore, I recommend you not ask strangers for their opinions about what they like, and focus on finding a car that suits your needs by perusing the latest Consumer Reports car buying guide, test driving the models that appeal to you, and then deciding for yourself.

Why then, is it so scary to invest $1000 more in an old car than you could sell it for next week?   This is particularly true if you are replacing it with a used car with no warranty.  Even if the used car is late model and low miles, there is a reason why someone got rid of it, and you don\u2019t know what that reason is.\nIn this particular case, if you have an S70 with the nicer, leather seats, there are no more comfortable seats anywhere, and lots of S70s ran beyond 300k miles.

I was looking specifically for:\n\nlegit 2 door coupe (specifically 2+2 seats config)\nmanual transmission\nRWD\nsold in Europe, new\nNOT German\n(somewhat) affordable\n\nThose are hard requirements. After some light research I realized that in current market dominated by regular boring cars in glorified trims attempting to make them a bit less boring (like BMW M, Audi RS, Ford ST etc.), one of VERY few cars that match all criteria is Ford Mustang.\nUnfortunately I\u2019m a bit more into cornering than straight line acceleration so I immediately got worried about Mustang bad handling reputation and general clumsiness. The only versions available in my country are V8 GT and V8 Mach 1 (EU spec, equivalent of Mach 1 PP1 in US, not possible to get PP2) so I\u2019m only considering Mach 1 as of now. To US people I\u2019d like to mention that Mustangs in EU are actually quite expensive and for example such Mach 1 costs here around 65k usd (80k usd incl. tax) so it\u2019s not really \u201cbargain\u201d and it actually scratches top of my budget for car.\nSo with all that in mind - is this bad reputation still true for 2021 Mustang GT with Magnet Ride suspension, especially Mach 1 variant? I know it\u2019s heavy but\u2026 so is Nissan GT-R for example. Yet still it\u2019s regarded as \u201csupercar killer\u201d. It seems to me really weird and counter intuitive that car so expensive, with such giant and actually decent tires could handle worse than eg. BRZ. Even considering lower weight. Because from all this hate train in the internet I got impression that Mustang handles worse than anything else on this planet including significantly cheaper cars\u2026 So is it really this bad or is it just some burden that follows new Mustangs because old ones were crappy and had solid rear axle?\nI mean it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna take this thing on track day every weekend but I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m driving a bus either\u2026 I\u2019m perfectly aware that German cars would handle better due to all those electronics etc but like I said I don\u2019t want German car so it\u2019s not really my goal.

I\u2019m still stupid and want to take advantage of that while I still can. Also yeah, it\u2019s gonna be my daily.\nNot trying many cars is also why I\u2019m mostly seeking for opinions in the internet hoping that there\u2019s someone who had opportunity to drive way more cars than I did and could comment on that matter having several years of experience. Since it\u2019s long term purchase I want it to be good and give me joy for years to come. Realizing after 2 years that \u201cdamn this thing drives like brick\u201d would be far from optimal. But so would be deciding after 2 years that \u201cdamn this thing totally lacks power\u201d if I got eg. BRZ  (which sounds likely considering that my current car has 2x more torque than BRZ, around the same power, about the same weight and it feels slow af). So it\u2019s though decision for me.\nThat\u2019s also why I didn\u2019t ask on Mustang related forums because it was obvious that everyone here would tell me how wonderful this car is, including people who never had any other car and  have no idea how it compares.\nMustang sounds like really versatile car that gives a bit of everything - a bit of power, a bit of practicality, a bit of sliding fun due to rwd and looks good.

When I started driving, in 1996, 4-wheel drive was uncommon even on trucks.  And I grew up in Illinois, so plenty of experience with winter driving.  The truth is that 4-wheel drive is unnecessary, and actually gives people a false sense of confidence when they would be better off to stay home or find a different route.\nIf the roads are truly icy or snowy or flooded to the point that a reasonable person would doubt their ability to safely proceed in a FWD economy car, then the danger level is too high, even if you are driving a 4WD pickup or SUV.  If having 4WD will make you take trips during harsh winter weather or attempt to cross flooded roads which you\u2019d otherwise not do, then it is an impediment to your safety, not a benefit.\nAs another person already mentioned, 4WD brings a huge fuel economy penalty versus 2WD.  It also makes it more difficult and expensive to replace tires, since all four must be identical.  On a 2WD vehicle, tires can be replaced in pairs, or if funds are really tight, just one tire can be replaced as long as the non-identical tires are on the undriven axle.", "If you want 4WD, take one with the 4-cyl for a long drive in the conditions you usually drive in, and see if you still want it. Comparing to the 6-cyl version by test driving it too can help you make a decision.", "Gonna have to disagree. I drove a 2WD 1974 F-100 (390, 3 speed manual, 4.11 gears, manual steering, manual brakes), during the blizzard of 1996.  It was a chore. 17 year old me slid off the road twice (but managed to extricate myself both times), during that week.  Fast forward 5 years and I was driving a 1995 Bronco, 4WD with a rear LSD.  We get another foot of snow, and the Bronco handles it much, much better,  sure-footed as a mountain goat. Every truck I\u2019ve gotten since then has been 4WD.  4WD is one of those things that you don\u2019t need most of the time, but when you do need it, it\u2019s invaluable.\nThe fuel economy argument varies from vehicle to vehicle; on the Taco there\u2019s a pretty big swing, the reason for this is not just the 4WD system, 2WD Tacos and 4WD Tacos are built differently,  more so than any other truck (as far as the differences between the 2WD and 4WD variants of the same model go).  The 4WD frame is beefier, and the suspension on the 4WD is much heavier as well. The 4WD version can be  900 pounds heavier than the 2WD version (for the 2010 model year),  which accounts for alot of the MPG difference.  Most other compact/mid-sized trucks don\u2019t have that much variation in weight when you go from 2WD to 4WD. The new Ranger for example only gains about 500 pounds. When you go from a base 2WD to a loaded 4WD model.  In most cases going from a 2WD model to a 4WD model of the same truck with the same drivetrain will lose you 1 or 2 MPG overall. It\u2019s a not a huge penalty in most cases.\nAs for tires; if you\u2019re rotating them like you should be, then they should be pretty close wear-wise.  On my 4WD vehicles, certainly I\u2019ve had tires that were worn somewhat more than others, but not to the point where I thought that I was gaining anything by not replacing all four.  Like two might\u2019ve been a 3/32\u2019s and the other two might\u2019ve been 4/32\u2019s. I might\u2019ve been able to eek out another 1500 miles before replacing the better tires, but it wouldn\u2019t be worth the hassle vs. just getting all four replaced right then and there.   Also  part time 4WD systems are tolerant of differing amounts of tire wear.  That\u2019s not going to hurt anything.  4WD isn\u2019t the same as AWD, there\u2019s no center diff metering out how much power goes where. it\u2019s a 50/50 split, and since you only use 4WD on slippery/forgiving surfaces there\u2019s enough slipping involved so that the fractions of an inch of difference in tire diameter is a non-factor.\nAnother benefit of 4WD is that everyone thinks they need it. So 4WD vehicles maintain their value better. When I traded in my 1997 F-150 a few years back. I was assuming I was going to get $1000 for it or near-scrap value as it was rusted out to the point where it was going to be marginal if it was going to be able to pass inspection next time around.  And it was a 20 year old truck.  I was surprised when I was offered $3500 trade in for it. The salesman said that it was working, very low mileage (for the year) 4WD truck, and they they could ship it up north and get over $5k for it at the minimum. But if were a 2WD truck, they would\u2019ve either declined the trade or given me $1000 for it.", "\n\n\n FoDaddy:\n\nGonna have to disagree.

I believe the year was 2006 or 2007 (I would have to view the Bill of Sales) my grandfather, who passed away in 2008, signed a bill of sale for several vehicles he either owned, or had possession of, to me. These vehicles included a 1963 Chevrolet C10, a 1972 Dodge Dart Custom, and a 1977 Oldsmobile Delta 88. I know for a fact the '63 Chevy belonged to my grandfather. I think the '72 Dodge belonged to his mother originally and no one wanted it so he came to collect it, and the '77 Oldsmobile belonged to my grandmother, (his wife.) I still have the Bill of Sales to these vehicles. They are all junk vehicles (really hate calling them that) or vehicles I would like to restore. I never had a place to take them to before, or the means to do it until recently. As if things weren\u2019t complicated enough, someone illegally obtained his land, then turned around and sold it. The vehicles, all except the '63 Chevy, are gone. Am I within right to contact the police about the '72 Dodge and '77 Oldsmobile so that I can reclaim them? I personally know the person that owns the land now and am going to ask about the '63 Chevy and my dad had a truck on that land that is in his name and will be reported as stolen so that it can be found. I am just curious about all of this because I plan on letting the guy know that I have a bill of sale for the '63 Chevy, and if I can I\u2019d like to recover these old vehicles that belonged, or were maybe passed down through my family. If anyone can give me guidance on this subject I would greatly appreciate it, and I know not to have a lot of hope on this matter.

If you have the time, money and want to make the effort you can generally track the paperwork to see if it was properly done and where it went to\u2026\nAgain, if you have proof of ownership you can certainly file a stolen property report with the police but again, if it was legally transferred you may not be able to reclaim it.\n\nAnd for a dose of reality, time and weather aren\u2019t friendly to a car left sitting for years and a proper restoration is expensive, frequently exceeding the value of the car so don\u2019t get your hopes too high.", "Why would someone think that anything from unknown persons on a Forum would be useful in this legal question ?", "I agree.

Mopars are pretty collectible and can bring a bit of money.

Thanks.\nJust to answer a few questions. When these vehicles were signed over to me I didn\u2019t have a place to put them. My grandfather and step-grandmother lived together and on the same property. When he passed, naturally the land went to her, as it should have. She was ok with the vehicles being there. A \u201cfriend\u201d of hers got power of attorney over her, durable POA for her money, non-durable POA for assets, lands, and other valuables. Long story short, the \u201cfriend\u201d took most, if not all, of her money, to go on trips out of country and do what she wanted to do. It got to the point where my step-grandmother was running down the street in her underwear screaming for help in the middle of the night. Finally, the lady had my step-grandmother put in a home or hospital and never let any of us know. We had no idea she was that bad off, or what had even happened to her. The friend then signed over the two pieces of property to herself and that was that. I\u2019m assuming someone thought she had a durable POA or no one knew my step-grandmother was deemed mentally incompetent, and yes, an investigation was done into her stare of mind and at the time those lands were sold she was deemed so. I reached out to the lady to speak about the vehicles and she never replied to.me.or anything. Then she sold the land for $40,000 to another person.\nThankfully, I know the person and he may have the vehicles. I am going to speak with him, but that is the reason why there was so much time had passed. If I were even able to recover them and restore them at this point, it would be a labor of love. It would be about honoring family through a skill or trade that applies to what was once theirs. It never has been about how much they were worth in dollars.\nI agree that this was a better legal question than one for an automobile forum, but sadly on any forum you run into the same problem. People want to belittle you for asking a question, or for things they don\u2019t know, and rather than ask they just put you down and knock you down lower. It was one of the reasons why I was hesitant to even post this here in the first place.\nP.s. The Dart is a 4 door, haha, but it has a 318 in it and those are good motors.

They went bankrupt something like 20 years ago and were bought out by a Chinese company.\nOP, why are you going to a mechanic for car audio advice. Most mechanics aren\u2019t also audio experts. You need to talk to a car audio installer. The Crutchfield suggestion is a good one, though you might not be able to order from them depending on what country you live in.", "Unless you are just sitting in a parking space with the engine off, the automobile is a lousy audio environment.  Even sitting in a parking space with the engine off, it is still not a very good audio environment.  It is full of hard surfaces that reflect too much sound muddying it up.  When moving, road noises and wind noise intrude making the low volume sections hard to hear and drowning out the higher frequencies.\nIt is also a temporary environment.  People tend to not keep their vehicles all that long, and you are starting with a vehicle that is already 13-14 years old.  Yet despite all this, some people will invest more in a sound system for their car than they will for their living room.\nBut, to answer your question, a low buck head unit will have some serious limitations to getting the most of the system.  One thing for example, you might compare two units that claim to have equal power out, the high end unit will claim (and probably actually have) a lower THD (total harmonic distortion). Many will be at 0.1% or lower while the cheaper unit will have 10% at max power, if they even list the THD at all.  Most cheap units won\u2019t because it is not good.\nTHD is very important as it caused by clipping the signal.  Think of a spring.  Let\u2019s say the initial stiffness of the spring is 1kG per cm of stretch or compression.  For the first 5 cm, it is pretty consistent.  5cm of compression or stretch requires 5kG, 3cm requires 3kG etc.  But as you go beyond 5cm, it requires more than 1kG for every cm, say 6.5kG to go to 6cm, 8.5kG to reach 7, 11kG to reach 8cm and 20kG to reach 9cm.  You. are approaching the limits of the spring.  To go from 5 to 9 cm require an additional 15kG.\nAn amplifier has limits too.  For example a 0.01v to 0.1v input may produce a 1 to 10 watt output that is linear.  But above a 0.1v input, less power out is produced so the output curve will start to flatten out.  When that happens, the amplifier starts to produce harmonics that did not exist in the original signal, thus distorting the input.\nThis is only one way the more expensive amplifier is worth the extra cost.  There are quite a few other parameters to be considered as well but this post would get way too long.  But the cost/quality curve is also non linear.  You might get a head unit that is 5x better than the cheapest one for only 2 to 3x the cost, but after that, the next 10% increase in quality could cost you 10x as much.\nI would also not waste money on a sub unless you listen to music that has low frequency tones.  Most music does not.  Music will a strong beat does not necessarily have a lower tone.  The beat is not the tone.  But if you do get a sub, it does not need to have a larger amp than the amps to the regular speakers,  if it is more powerful, it can also distort the sound.", "Needs are air,water, food, shelter, everything else is wants.", "I\u2019m really confused (or I think you are).

It sounds like you mean \u201cHead Unit\u201d   The head unit is the part of the system you interact with, it can have a radio/CD player/USB port/AUX input etc, on it.  Most modern head units don\u2019t have CD players anymore, as most people use bluetooth or flash drives to play music.  I haven\u2019t used a CD in about a decade.\nWhen it comes to quality, you get what you pay for. The last vehicle I had that I did an extensive aftermarket system was my old Bronco.  This would\u2019ve been back in the late 90\u2019s/early 2000\u2019s.  It replaced the factory head unit (AM/FM/tape player) with a Sony headunit that was AM/FM/CD.  I replaced the crap factory speakers with Infinite Kappas ( 6.5 inch 3 way in the front doors,  6x9 2 way in the back),  added a 4 channel 400W (I think) JL audio amp to feed the Kappas, which were very power-hungry speakers.  And added a subwoofer box in the cargo area with two JL Audio 10\u2019s powered by a JL audio 2 channel amp which was on the order of 600 watts.\nThe results were impressive to 20 year old me.  However as I got older and more boring, having a banging sound system became less of a priority.  Though these days I\u2019m tempted to do some more quality of life improvements to my Mustang. There\u2019s certainly room for improvement, but I really like Sync 3 and would probably just replace the factory speakers and maybe do an inline amp, and possible a stealth box sub in the trunk.\nAnyway,  a new modern head unit will probably get you some of the functionality you\u2019re looking for (Bluetooth, USB, etc.) However a cheap head unit will not likely produce hugely better sound quality as cheap head units don\u2019t always have noticeably more power (watts ) than a factory radio.   Peak wattage isn\u2019t nearly as important as continuous (RMS) wattage.  Also different speakers respond better to differing amounts of power. The factory speakers almost certainly are made with lower power in mind, and they are likely of dubious quality.  Aftermarket speakers are almost always better in terms of quality, but some of the higher end ones only sound their best when they are being fed more power than a typical head unit can provide (this is where amplifiers come in). Of course there are also aftermarket speakers that are made to be powered by the head unit only as well.\nSubwoofers, particularly ones that are mounted in the trunk/boot require some planning.  How many do you want/need?  What size?, How much power is it going to take?  Can you use the head unit to bypass certain frequencies?  Can the trunk/boot be effectively matted to keep unwanted/unsoundly vibrations in check?", "This is what I\u2019d do.\n#1 get a new head unit with a CD player (if you want).

Preferring an SUV is fine.  Preferring a mid-sized vehicle is fine.\nHowever, unless you actually do need a mid-size SUV consider widening your search to include crossovers and sedans such as a Toyota RAV-4, Camry, or Corolla, a Honda CRV, Accord, or Civic, etc.  You might find a newer vehicle and/or one with fewer miles in good condition that is within your budget.\nAs others have pointed out, absolutely have any vehicle you decide to buy checked over by your own mechanic BEFORE you make the purchase.  It will cost you about $100 or perhaps a bit more but can save you from buying a major problem.\nAbsolutely take the vehicle for a thorough test drive that includes:\n\n\nBoth highway and non-highway driving.  Test drive with the radio, air conditioning, heat off so you can listen to the vehicle while also paying attention to how it handles, steers, rides, corners, goes over road bumps, etc.\n\n\nIs your driver visibility comfortable?  Can mirrors be set where they work for you?\n\n\nHow comfortable is the seat?  Hint: A five minute drive around the block won\u2019t work to tell you real use seat comfort or other important things about how the vehicle drives.\n\n\nHow smoothly does the transmission shift?

Headlights both low and high beam and, DRLs, tail lights, turn signals, interior lights.\n\n\nTurn on the a/c to see how well it works including while driving.  Same then with the heat on.\n\n\nSee how well the windows work going up and down, both from the driver\u2019s control and from the individual window controls on each door.\n\n\nSee how well all doors, rear hatch or trunk lid, and front hood open, close, and properly latch.\n\n\nCheck if the door locks work.  That includes the fob button controls if the vehicle has fob control; the interior electronic lock button; the interior manual lock buttons; and using the physical key in the exterior lock/s to both lock and unlock.\n\n\nDoes the radio work?\n\n\nCheck to see if it comes equipped with a spare tire.  If not then budget to add one after purchase if it is a vehicle designed to carry a spare.\n\n\nDo all the seat belts / shoulder belts work properly.\n\n\nWhen starting the vehicle do all the dash warning symbols come on momentarily as a system check?\n\n\nAre there any dash warning symbols lighted up that stay on and/or come on while the engine is running?\n\n\nLook under the hood at the engine.  Pull the oil dipstick, wipe it off, reinsert it, pull it back out and check the oil level.  Pay attention if it is clean or dirty and if dirty how grungy.\n\n\nIs the coolant level in the reservoir at proper marked level?\n\n\nIs brake fluid at proper marked level in the brake fluid reservoir?\n\n\nFrom a distance of ten or twelve feet squat down and eyeball the vehicle on all sides.  Does it sit properly squared up?  Is it sagging somewhere?  Are the front and rear tires offset such it would track \u201cdogged\u201d when driving?\n\n\nAny visible rust?  Note: Most older vehicles have some rust.  Where and how much is crucial to find out.  This is part of why you want a professional mechanic of your choosing to examine your final vehicle choice BEFORE buying.  You need to know how serious any rust to frame, brake lines, suspension components, etc. is and if it is serious enough to pass on buying.\n\n\n@BDazzle Remember, know your worth as a person and do not let anyone bully you or insult you.

Don\u2019t let anyone rush or pressure you.  That includes, if necessary, asking the sales person to step away and let you look and think in quiet.  If s/he goes along for the test drive, which is often the case, courteously but firmly ask for s/he to be quiet and not talk so you can concentrate on how the vehicle drives and sounds.

Guess I\u2019m not clear on if you are talking about the old rear engine Beetle or the new front engine models when you say you like the retro stuff. The PT was such a big hit when it came out that GM hired the designer to build the HHR which was actually a better vehicle in most regards. I remember that we ran out of PTs many times due to how popular they were at the time. I must ay that the PT Dream Cruiser was pretty cool too! They were usually sold before they got to the deal\u00e9rship. Regardless of either choice it comes down to what you prefer and can afford to get fixed and keep up, maintenance wise. Both the PT and new Beetle, made for US sales, were assembled in Mexico. Not that it matters but just a point of information. PT parts and service are MUCH less expensive for sure. VW parts and service are much more. Many mechanics and shops have told us they won\u2019t work on them due to being such a pain to work on and diagnos and tell us to go to a dealership. My girlfriend has an 08 EOS that\u2019s a pain in the butt, as many are from others we\u2019ve talked to. She has taken it to the shop countless times due to a check engine light that no one seems to be able to diagnos. They send it out with the light off then before she gets home it pops back on again so no inspection sticker again over and over and over. It has a 2.0 turbo that is VERY quick and the retractable hard top is cool! It looks like Transformer when it operates. I believe the new Beetle was offered with the same engine as a choice as well but I\u2019m not totally sure. Her\u2019s is an 08 and the interior panels are seperating, the glue doesn\u2019t hold the faux leather to the panels anymore and there are countless other issues both cosmetic and mechanical. She\u2019s had bad luck with it and we\u2019ve heard so many horror stories from others about similar newer VWs, that we won\u2019t be getting one in the future that I can see. I remember at the Dodge dealership our used car sales manager would extremely \u201clowball\u201d the trade #'s on the new beetle that customers brought in because he said they just weren\u2019t worth it. These are just my experiences with VW in the past decade so you can see my obvious prejudice against them. Maybe someone else on here can give you better info than I can but they aren\u2019t for me. Now, the older VWs? Heck yeah! Reliability, nostalga and easy to work on. I\u2019ll buy a good used Rabbit (very rare to find), Beetle, Karman Ghia or bus any day! The original Beetles\u2026 4 bolts, some wires to disconnect, fuel line and 2 people could lift the engine to a stand or table to work on if needed. I\u2019ve had 3 VWs in the past. My dad had 2. All were a blast! The newer models\u2026 No thanks. Again, just my opinion and bad personal experiences.", "I was leaning towards the PT. As for when I\u2019m looking what year do you recommend for both the normal hatch back and for the convertibles. I\u2019ve read the main problem with the PTs is the belt.

At a certain point the belt will need to be replaced apperantly and is pretty labor intensive if you can\u2019t do the work yourself. It\u2019s best I defer that to someone else with more technical knowledge though. In that case I would try to find one that you can verify when it was last done which may be difficult to find out.

I bought it new and an idiot on his cell phone totaled it at 7 1/2 years old. I will say, it protected us well, we only got bumps and bruises. The only repairs I had were one wheel bearing and the oil pressure sending unit.\nHaving said that, these cars do not age well.  The TIPM under the hood is especially troublesome. It controls almost everything electrical and experiences many internal solder failures. I have two granddaughters that owned them, they were both rust free examples from Florida. They were cheap to buy because the marketplace does not regard them well. The duel mileage is bad, the maximum I ever got on the highway was 22.\nAs for the timing belt, I never changed mine. It is not really an interference engine, the valves will not hit the pistons.  I talked to an engineer and asked why some references list it as one. He said there is a remote chance of the valves hitting each other if the belt breaks at high rpm. I never drove mine at high rpm, it is not even remotely a performance car.\nIn the vibe or Matrix, avoid the 2.4 engine, it is also a gas hog.Vibes are usually cheaper in the same condition.", "My big concern no matter the vehicle type is the rust issue because you live in Michigan.

I finally donated the mower to Goodwill industries.  I decided I could buy a lot of gasoline for the $65 I would spend every two years for batteries.  These were sealed lead acid batteries.  I assume the lithium ion batteries on the new mowers are better.", "@Triedaq I agree on purely economic grounds. The good electric cars are jaw-droppingly expensive, and the cheap electric cars are. . .Well.  Cheap.  And even on the good ones, the more shenanigans Musk pulls, the less sad I am that I couldn\u2019t quite swing a Tesla on my last car purchase. The last one where he remotely disabled options that customers were told they were getting because \u201cwell the first owner paid for them, but the second owner did not\u201d was the final straw for me as far as supporting Tesla as a company. Hopefully Lucid builds a good competitor and doesn\u2019t pull the shady moves Tesla is becoming known for.\nThe new Leaf is showing a lot more promise as they finally got into the triple digits for range, and the price isn\u2019t too far out of line from what you\u2019d pay for a normal gas car.  But $40,000 will still buy a lot of car and pull you out of the compact hatchback market, so it\u2019s still in some ways a sacrifice. And unlike with the Teslas, if you buy a $40,000 Leaf you don\u2019t get supercar levels of acceleration to play with.\nNow, if your thinking leads you to places other than pure economics and also to the ecological then electric cars make more sense, because the sooner they become more popular, the sooner their prices come down so that other people can buy them. And unlike a gas car, electric cars can run on clean, renewable power sources. And even if they aren\u2019t currently plugged into such sources, when the power company builds a new wind/solar farm, the car gets cleaner. That\u2019s something that can\u2019t be said for gas burners. And as an aside, I assume OP is not thinking ecologically, because replacing your car every 2-3 years is not ecologically sound.\nOn the mower, interestingly (well, probably not interesting to anyone but me) I just traded a perfectly good Honda mower for a Stihl battery-powered one. We\u2019ve removed so much grass in favor of landscaping and native plant beds that dealing with gas just didn\u2019t make sense anymore. I can now mow the lawn in 30 minutes flat.  I\u2019m enjoying the new mower for the most part. It\u2019s a lot more quiet than any gas mower, and cuts well. There are a few annoyances, the biggest one involving the drive motor staying engaged after you release the bar. It doesn\u2019t move the mower, but you can\u2019t pull the mower backwards until you push it slightly forward. Irritating, but that\u2019s not unusual on 2nd gen battery mowers, and it removes the annoyances of stabilizing fuel, changing oil, etc.", "\n\n\n shadowfax:\n\nOn the mower, interestingly (well, probably not interesting to anyone but me)\n\n\nThere are a lot of us that really do like the latest models of battery powered mowers .", "@shadowfax.

Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll find yourself the owner of a car that can easily cost you another $1,000 to simply get on the road.\nSo first look at the Title. Is the name on the title the same as the Seller\u2019s? Is the Title from another State? Is there a Lien on the Title w/o a Lien Release attached? Is the Tile marked Salvage or anything else? If so, run don\u2019t walk.\nIs the car being sold with a clean Inspection? If not tell the Seller that you\u2019ll pay for the State Inspection ($100 and another $100 for the mechanic\u2019s opinion) and pay full price for the car if it passes.\nIt will cost the Seller nothing so an honest seller should have no problem with this if the car\u2019s  \u201cclean\u201d but will probably eliminate 90% of the \u201cdeals\u201d right off the bat because the Seller knows something that he\u2019s not telling you.\nAnother poster mentioned a small used car lot, which isn\u2019t a bad idea.\nAlthough it will cost more, if you buy the car fully tagged and ready to go and at least you know that it\u2019s passed State Inspection, the title is good and it\u2019s driveable.\nBottom line, Craigslist can be a good site to buy a \u201cGrandma died and the kids just want to unload it\u201d used cars but it can also be used by Curbstoners selling cars \u201cfresh from the bottom of the lake\u201d with an equally \u201cwashed\u201d title and Deadbeats trying to unload a \u201cSoon to be Repo\u2019d\u201d car on an unsuspecting buyer.", "It is clear to me that you should have any car inspected by a mechanic.

I saw test drove the car this morning and I checked every item in the checklist including the fluids (except the transmission fluid which in this car doesn\u2019t have a dipstick). Everything was fine except the brake fluid was brown. The car drove great, with no odd engine sounds, shifting was smooth, no vibrations, or creaks. The one issue was that when I did a hard brake from 30mph to a stop, after resuming gas again there was a weird sound like the brake was sticking or something. It went away after getting up to speed again. I called the mechanic I looked up on google maps in the morning and told him that and he said to bring the car in. After a 2 hour inspection, he said the car is in good shape though he did find two things to be fixed immediately and a few down the line. But he said it\u2019s a good car at 90k miles and should make it to 250k miles.\nImmediate needs:\nSerpentine belt is cracked: $140 to fix\nBrake fluid dark with 4% moisture: $110 to fix\nFuture needs:\nWiper motor is noisy and maybe failing: $420 to fix\nTune up due at 96k miles: $320\nInner CV boots cracked, right side leaking grease: $480 to fix\nFront tires are down to 30% tread and back tires are mismatched: $520 to replace all 4\nRear brakes down to 4/32: $330 to fix\nI wasn\u2019t sure how much to ask the seller to discount the car further for the above, so I figured I\u2019d ask for all the immediate needs of $250 plus a bit more, so I suggested to knock down the price from $2300 to $1900. He said he really didn\u2019t want to go below $2000, and I asked the mechanic on the side if $1900 was a fair price and he said it was in the ballpark so I just agreed to $2000 since the seller was a super nice guy and had already come down in price so much. Did I do ok?\nI left the car at the mechanics to get the immediate fixes done, but I haven\u2019t decided on the future needs items yet.

The Kia has low enough miles that you could have the transmission fluid changed after you buy it, and not need to worry that its life has been shortened by insufficient maintenance.\nSince Korean-branded vehicles also depreciate faster than Japanese-branded models, we can assume that it also costs less than the Honda.

Six of one\u2026  \nI always take internet reviews or complaints with a grain of salt.\nOf the two, Option 1 would be my choice although I agree that CPO may not mean much.

This, of course, specifically excludes any third-party \u201cextended warranty\u201d or \u201cservice plan\u201d or similar pseudo-insurance backed by any entity other than the manufacturer itself.  Anything this recent, and with such low miles is going to be expensive, and will necessitate a monthly loan payment for most people.\nor\nBuy an inexpensive older car, which obviously won\u2019t have a warranty, but it also won\u2019t have a monthly loan payment either.\n\nPersonally, I prefer strategy #2.  I live in southern Arizona, so cars don\u2019t rust.  Therefore, a 15-20 year old car for $1500-2500 is a good buy, and even with maintenance and repairs is a bargain compared to a monthly payment and full-coverage insurance on a financed vehicle.\nHowever, buying this 8 year old Hyundai with 78,000 miles doesn\u2019t conform to either of these strategies.  It\u2019s too old to have any manufacturer\u2019s warranty (remember that the 10-year 100,000 powertrain warranty is available only to the original owner) and it\u2019s way to expensive to be considered a disposable car if major repairs are needed.  If you\u2019re comfortable spending $6k, then I\u2019d spend 2-3k more and get a newer car with much less miles.

At the very least, borrow a carpet shampooer and clean up the stains.\nLook at it this way, even if it were otherwise worth $1900, you can deduct a couple hundred to replace the windshield, $1,000 to fix the air conditioner, and who knows how much to fix the check engine light that absolutely must be fixed before the next owner can register the car.

Subaru\u2019s of that general vintage with 160kmi to over 250kmi with no serious issues (though a friend\u2019s 2006 H4 OB needed head gaskets at ~ 90Kmi).  At the  mileage you\u2019re considering much will depend upon the use and care it\u2019s received.\nThings we like:  engine power - gobbs of it, at 95mph up hill in hot desert pushing a roof top box there\u2019s still passing reserve.  Transmission, and AWD in Sierra winters (with the right tires) work well.  Love the ground clearance.  Brakes are great.  Handling is good (Pirelli All Season tires were fine on snow and ice and the present Michelins are even better, the Maine contingent likes Continentals).  A/C is strong, even at 108degrees in desert.  It\u2019s comfortable on trips and pretty quiet, the sun roof is nice (be sure all 4 drains flow freely, the rear drains are hidden behind the wrap around bumper).  Despite what some say spark plugs are relatively easy to change, following on-line instructions.  Same for full ATF flushes, lines are easy to reach.  The engine seems to do as well on Subaru\u2019s conventional oil as it does on Subaru\u2019s and several other brands of synthetics.  Suggest changing <=5,000mi. (judging from continuous, summer interstate driving, any type oil) or 6mo., whichever is sooner - the owner\u2019s. manual seems too long even for synthetics.\nNot as great:  Gas mileage - ~ 24-25mpg (premium) on interstates once the oil is warmed up and with very smooth transitions isn\u2019t too bad, but going ~ 20-25mi. per trip on freeway gives ~ 20mpg, and mileage drops to  15-16mpg around town when driving 5-8mi. at a time.    The front struts were bad at 47kmi and bushings had collapsed  (they were 11yrs old) - there are better after-market struts.  A front CV boot split at ~ 60kmi  (the joint was good, so repaired with a $25 NAPA boot kit).\nCatalytic converter heat shields are rattle prone - very expensive at the dealer but there are home brew ways to clamp them.\nSubaru AWD especially doesn\u2019t like mismatched tires (wears out the mechanism), check that all tires are the same model, size, and very close to the same wear.  Tires should be within about 0.25inches (6mm) of each other in circumference (I measure with a flat tape), and rotated at the specified interval.\nThere are some complaints on the forums about valve cover gasket oil leaks and ours may be starting, but much less expensive than head gasket repair.  Inspect for both head and valve cover leaks.\nThe auto cabin temp controls are a pain, set 1 degree higher or lower than the present temperature  and they blast full hot or cold until the new set point is reached.   We live with it.\nThe cabin air filter requires perhaps 40 minutes and many screws to change, but easier the second time.   Ours is loaded up by 20,000mi.\nHead light bulb changing (halogens) is a moderate pain, but doable.  Illumination is good.\nThe FM radio range is much weaker than our other cars, but this might be just ours.\nCheck out the forum subaruoutback.org 3", "\n\n\n Dave514:\n\nDoes anyone know anything about this year and model and if it has had ongoing issues?\n\n\nAt 14 years old and that mileage the vehicle has to stand on it\u2019s own merits.

Tire Rack, Discount Tire, and others list the circumference limits as 0.25in for Subarus as opposed to 0.5in. for most other makes - a potential explanation is that the Subaru system is engaged full time and thus always \u201cslipping\u201d whereas others wait for detection of slippage at the wheels before engaging (but this is beyond my direct knowledge).  I know of one person, who races cars and has a complete shop, whose personal ride is an older Outback with manual transmission (I believe the MT versions have a different coupler design than the AT\u2019s) that had mismatched tire brands when he purchased it used.

Even got through places were 4WD drivers (w/ snow tires but not chains) got stuck.  Only have it now because of it was passed down through the family (my wife likes it!)

My mom suggests that a newer car (2010 and up) will be far better, however, the used cars are usually $7k+ and already have 75-125k miles on them. Common ones I\u2019ve seen are elantra, sentra, altimas, focus, dart, and basically every other compact other than corollas or civics. I obviously don\u2019t want to spend the extra money if I don\u2019t have to. Will one of the newer cars be so much better in terms of reliability vs cost as my mom believes, or am I better off with a decent example of the Lexus. Priorities are reliability, purchase cost, and repairability, and for my sake, driving experience.\nEdit: I want to find out if the $3k price difference is really worth the upgrade in overall reliability in the case of two cars that are decent examples.

I made the rookie mistake of purchasing a 2011 Subaru Tribeca with third row seating thinking that I could skip the lackluster minivan life. As soon as baby two came home and we went for a family ride I realized I made a mistake-it\u2019s too small to fit anyone else in it and the third row isn\u2019t accessible with car seats installed in the middle row, but I can\u2019t get the baby\u2019s seat in in the third.

I like simplicity-not a lot of bells and whistles, and I need a minivan that will drive my kiddos and around town and the occasional summer trip to MI from IN.\nI\u2019ve been looking at 2009-2011ish Siennas and Odysseys with anywhere from 82-130k mi under 11,500. We\u2019d put some $ down and finance the remainder hoping for less than $100/mo payments. BUT THEN I found a private sale single owner 2000 Sienna w 104k mi asking 3,400. I pulled the Carfax and it seems it was well maintained by the dealership it was purchased from, but is not showing records for long periods of time. I wonder if this means oil changes happened at home? One hopes?\nSo here\u2019s my question: we\u2019re going to have a used car inspection on the 2000.

I often have my fellow musicians with their instruments in the minivan.  I have moved a set of 4 timpani with my minivans.

A car with too few miles can be bad and one with too many can be bad, but it is still condition of the vehicle that is most important.\nI buy and drive older cars, usually from individuals. Aside from being attracted by advertised miles, I am always afforded the opportunity to inspect them and I can be seen on the ground, front, back, both sides, under the hood, looking and probing for condition issues.\nI know quite a bit about  checking out used cars and usually wear out my welcome at the sellers location before deciding on a purchase. Sometimes they mind my thoroughness, sometimes they don\u2019t, and I never mind them caring one way or another. If I can\u2019t get a good check I walk away.\nFor folks not all that vehicle inspection savvy, they should probably either not buy used cars OR at least have a used vehicle inspected by a competent, trusted mechanic PRIOR to purchase, not AFTER purchase.

For sure, that must be checked before purchase.\nAnyhow, if the car runs well, looks okay, drives okay, drive it. Keep having inspections and when it comes time when the rust has had its way with it and it becomes unsafe then stop driving it. Attach the license plates to another car. Every car has this day, some sooner than others.\nHopefully it will work out okay.

Depending, of course, what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d come to.\nIf the Caravan has ANY evidence of a past accident, ANY rust or body damage, or has a salvage/rebuilt/reconstructed title, I\u2019d walk away.  Many of these vans make it to a quarter of a million miles without major issues, so I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably a good 30,000 to 40,000 miles left in this thing.  I would assume that if the previous owner had not changed the oil regularly, or had the transmission fluid changed at least once, this would not have reached 150,000 miles, let alone 216,000 miles.\nJust do the usual due diligence:\n\nBring an inexpensive OBDII code reader/scan tool.  Plug it in to the diagnostic port immediately before you start the engine.\n\nPrior to starting the engine, check the oil with the dipstick, and open the oil fill cap and look inside for evidence of sludge buildup.  Put the oil fill cap back on.  There is no transmission dipstick on this model, otherwise I\u2019d suggest checking that too for fluid condition only (level can only be checked with the engine idling in park).\nStart the engine from cold, open the radiator cap, make sure there aren\u2019t any bubbles as the engine warms up, put the radiator cap back on, make sure the temperature gauge reaches the normal position and the heater works.  Check under the vehicle to ensure there aren\u2019t any leaks.\nAs the engine warms up, examine the body for fit and finish, again check for fluid leaks, check your code reader/scan tool to make sure there are no current, pending, or permanent codes set, and that no more than one monitor says \u201cnot ready\u201d.  (This is the most that is permitted on a 2001 or newer vehicle, to still be able to pass emissions/inspection.)\nTake a long test-drive, lasting for at least 20 minutes and at least 15 miles, driven both in city traffic (so you can see if the engine overheats or misfires at low speed, or if the transmission has difficulty upshifting on demand) and on a freeway or other road with a 50 MPH or higher speed limit (so you can see if the engine overheats or misfires at high speed, or the transmission slips or whines in higher gears).  Begin the test-drive by backing out of a parking space, so you can see that reverse works.\n\nAt the conclusion of the test-drive, but before turning the engine off, again connect your code reader/scan tool, and make sure no current, pending, or permanent codes have set.  Also, test all of the power windows, power door locks, power sliding door/liftgate (if equipped), sunroof/moonroof (if equipped), power seats (if equipped), and if the weather is warm enough, test the A/C if that feature is important to you, test the audio system if that feature is important to you.\n\nAnd of course, after you buy it, I would change the engine oil and oil filter, coolant, transmission fluid and filter (drain-and-fill, not a flush), check the brake pads and replace if low.  DIY is best for these things, but if that\u2019s not an option, use a reputable independently-owned shop\u2013not a chain and definitely not a Jiffy Lube-type place.", "\n\n\n Eppersod:\n\nI don\u2019t know the maintenance history\n\n\n\nThink about it:\nThe owner of this vehicle apparently drove it over 50k miles per year, or over 1,000 miles per week.  That type of usage surely doesn\u2019t leave much \u201cdowntime\u201d for performing maintenance.   But, perhaps it was properly maintained.   \nIf you can verify that the trans fluid has been changed at least 7 times, and if you can verify that the oil has been changed at least 40 times, then it might be worth considering, in view of the low asking price.   Just be prepared to have to overhaul the transmission in the very near future\u2013even if the fluid was changed 7 times already.", "As a family car, it should be reliable, and a car with mileage this high won\u2019t be.

In those days the reading didn\u2019t mean much as dealers were known to reset odometers.\nThat said, if you are seriously interested in the car, an inspection by an independent mechanic may be able to find clues as to how the vehicle was used.  If a the vehicle was used to commute 60 miles each way to a job, or the previous owner was an over- the- road salesman, there may be some miles left in the vehicle.  Highway driving is relatively easy on a car.  On the other hand, if the vehicle was used for taxi cab service, it\u2019s probably worn out.  Worn pedal pads, worn upholstery, etc may be a clue to this type of service.\nOn your end, how do you plan to use the vehicle?  Will it be used locally or are you intending to use it for a 100 mile commute to work each day?
